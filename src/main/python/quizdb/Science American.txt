This man wrote the essay "Mind and Matter," in which he asserted the oneness of mind in order to resolve the arithmetical paradox. The relativistic Klein-Gordon equation is a form of his namesake equation, which can be simplified using the BornÂ–Oppenheimer approximation. This author of What is Life? illustrated the problem of the Copenhagen interpretation in an experiment involving a hammer, a radioactive source, a Geiger counter, and a flask of poison. For 10 points, name this physicist whose namesake equation describes how the wave function evolves over time, and whose namesake thought experiment involves a simultaneously dead and alive cat

A decrease in cytoplasmic pH causes the protonation of a histidine residue in the arginine-rich loop D of this class of proteins.  The lack of Colton antigens is a marker for deficiency of one protein in this family, and the major intrinsic protein of the lens is sometimes referred to as number zero of this family.  Knocking out number nine of this family was shown to improve survival after malarial infection by the man who discovered this family, Peter Agre.  The best-known members of this family are number one, which maintains red blood cell osmotic pressure, and number two, whose expression is upregulated by ADH and which is found in the collecting duct of the kidney.  For 10 points, name these protein channels through which water passes.
