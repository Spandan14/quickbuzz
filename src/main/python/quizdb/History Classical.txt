This battle saw the capture of Psyttaleia by a recently turned general named Aristides. One side included the female general Artemisia, which prompted her leader to note that his female general became a man and his male generals became women. Accounts differ over whether an early retreat by Adeimantus at this battle was out of cowardice or to force the enemy into an enclosed area. This battle was fought after one sided retreated following the Battle of Artemisium and included a force led by Eurybiades of Sparta. During it, Themistocles led a force of about 270 triremes that opposed a force sent by Xerxes I south of the Isthmus of Corinth.

To become emperor, he won the Battle of Margus after his predecessor, Carus, was struck by lightning. In one story, this emperor was asked to return to the throne but decided he was happier living as a cabbage farmer at his palace in Split. Rapid inflation prompted him to introduce a coin called the argenteus and establish price controls with his Edict on Maximum Prices. He is remembered for allegedly martyring 20,000 people at Nicomedia, an action later outlawed by Constantine's Edict of Milan.

The poems of Tyrtaius and Alkman are roughly contemporaneous sources for this document, which was probably written in the early 600s BC. According to Plutarch, its author obtained a Delphic prophecy exhorting its adoption. Both Xenophon and Aristotle wrote books about this document, lauding its promotion of eunomia. The latter’s commentary is lost and the former entirely neglects the motive for the  institutions this document created, such as the agoge and the krypteia. That motive was the continued subjugation of the numerically superior inhabitants of the Messenian plain, who were forced to serve as helots after losing two wars to the state this document governed.

Isocrates bemoaned this city's fate in his 14th oration, after its citizens fled Theban domination for refuge in
Athens in 373 BC. This city was the site of the cult of Hellenic Homonoia, as well as the Eleutheria games. It gives
its name to an oath – probably specious - in which the Greeks undertook not to rebuild sanctuaries destroyed by the
Persians. Mardonius retreated to this Boeotian city situated between Mt. Cithaeron and the Asopus river after his
offer of an Athenian alliance was rejected. It was there that the remaining Persians on the Greek mainland were

The earliest finds of this item come from the Sintashta-Petrovka culture, found north of the Aral Sea and dated to around 2500 BC. The first text describing these items in the ancient Near East recounts how King Hattusili I used them against the Hurrians during the conquest of Hattusa, and a later Hurrian-Hittite text written by one Kikkuli of the Mitanni describes a conditioning regimen lasting 214 days.

Thucydides claimed that it occurred approximately 80 years after the fall of Troy, shortly before 1200 BC. The pottery record of Sparta, however, indicates a date closer to 900 BC, and it likely caused the Ionian migration that founded Greek-speaking states in Asia Minor.

This man fought under Aulus Gabinius against Aristobulus II in Judaea, after he traveled to Greece, ostensibly to learn rhetoric, but more likely to escape the creditors to whom he owed 250 talents. That debt resulted from a period of youthful recklessness in which he was friends with Curio, who was later the tribune bribed by an ally of this man before this man became tribune himself in 49 BC. In one battle, after advancing his men through the marsh on his right flank, he was able to outmaneuver his enemy, causing his opponent to have his freedman Pindarus run him through.

One of these people quoted the Hebrew scripture "Vanity of vanities, all is vanity" upon being led into the hippodrome in Constantinople as part of a triumph. That occurred after he sent his brother Tzazo to put down the rebellion of Goddas and was subsequently left without enough of an army to successfully defend Ad Decimum.

Eight legions - the most then assembled - took part in this clash, an obsession of von Schlieffen, which led to the (*) principes being deployed farther behind the hastati and the permanent adoption of the strategy of Fabius Cunctator.
