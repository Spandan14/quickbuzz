Given integers a and b, this function on the quantity a to the n plus b to the n is divisible by n. The values of this function are given by the Mobius transform on the sequence of positive integers. For all n greater than 1, the splitting field of the polynomial [x to the n] minus 1 equals this function of n. This function on n can be calculated as the product of n and the quantity 1 minus p for all primes p which divide n. For any integer a relatively prime to n, a to the power of this function of n is equivalent to 1 mod n by a corollary of Lagrange's theorem. For a prime number p, this function is equal to p minus 1, since p has no divisors except 1 and itself.

One namesake of this result is also the namesake of an order formula for objects containing only two conjugacy classes, and that namesake also names a series with McKay used to prove the "moonshine conjecture" of Conway and Norton. Bender's method was used to streamline the proof of this result. This result was first proven based on work done by Michio Suzuki, and was restricted to objects for which the centralizer of every non-trivial element is nilpotent. The proof of this result showed that each non-trivial irreducible character arises only once as an exceptional character, and used the method of local analysis; that proof was over 200 pages long. This theorem was originally developed based on a conjecture by Burnside, which asked whether finite simple groups of odd order exist.

n a Butcher tableau, this method is diagrammed with zeroes in the top row and a one in the bottom right. The first step of the Adams-Bashforth methods use this procedure. Huen's method is a variant on this procedure though his method's error scales with the interval cubed while this one scales with the interval squared. Implicit versions of this method and its variations are used for stiff equations. It is a first-order Runge-Kutta method.

This algorithm can be modified to an "adaptive" form by increasing the step size when the error is too small and decreasing it when it is too large, leading the error to oscillate about the optimum value.

The most common form of this algorithm is its fourth-order variant, in which doubling the number of steps leads to a 16-fold reduction in error. This algorithm improves on the Taylor algorithm by not having to compute derivatives, and it begins with a calculation identical to the Euler method.

A sweep-line algorithm that accomplishes this process via a divide-and-conquer strategy with a computational complexity of O(n log n) was developed by Garey.

Fisk used this process, followed by a 3-coloring, to give a short proof of Chvatal's art gallery theorem. Chazelle demonstrated a linear time method for performing this operation (*) on a simple polygon , and a method for carrying out this process such that the result satisfies the empty circumcircle property was developed by Delaunay.

A graph is vertex transitive, if, for every pair of vertices, there exists one of these objects with a certain property. If the number of these operations for a field extension is equal to its degree, the extension is Galois.

A subgroup is characteristic if every one of these operations for the group maps the subgroup to itself. For a finite vector space, the group of these is the general linear group. For the complex numbers considered as a field, there are uncountably many highly-discontinuous (*) "wild" ones, but complex conjugation is the only non-trivial continuous example.

A vector on a Hilbert space is described by this term if there exists a bounded linear operator such that the orbits of the operator on the vector are dense in the Hilbert space. A group is called virtually this if it contains one of these groups, and that group has a nite number of cosets. For every n, there exists exactly one of these groups with n elements, and the only simple Abelian groups are the instances of these groups with non-composite order. These groups correspond to the rotational symmetries of a polygon. For ten points, identify this class of groups with one generator of which every element is a power.

Simon Stevin proved this result for polynomials by constructing the decimal expansion of a solution, and a function is said to be Darboux if it ful lls the property laid out in this result. Bolzano's theorem is equivalent to this result, which is true because continuous functions take connected sets to connected sets. This theorem fails to be true for the rationals because they are not con- nected; for example, although there exist rationals a,b such that a2 = 0 and b2 = 4, there exists no rational c such that c2 = 2. For ten points, identify this result from real analysis stating that any function from the interval [a,b] to the real line must assume every value between f(a) and f(b).

A form of this property named for Melnikov generalizes it to measures, and the scalar form of this quantity is equal to the product of the metric tensor and the Ricci tensor. One form of this quantity is de ned as the determinant of theshape operator and is named for Gauss.

If a patch is regular and has this property, then it maps its domain di eo- morphically onto its codomain.

A functor having this property on maps is called faithful, and if it has this property on objects as well, it is called an   embed- ding. Continuous functions from R to R with this property must be monotone. If there exists a function with this property from X to Y and also from Y to X, then X and Y must have the same cardinality.
