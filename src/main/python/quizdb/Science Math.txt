One namesake of this result is also the namesake of an order formula for objects containing only two conjugacy classes, and that namesake also names a series with McKay used to prove the "moonshine conjecture" of Conway and Norton. Bender's method was used to streamline the proof of this result. This result was first proven based on work done by Michio Suzuki, and was restricted to objects for which the centralizer of every non-trivial element is nilpotent. The proof of this result showed that each non-trivial irreducible character arises only once as an exceptional character, and used the method of local analysis; that proof was over 200 pages long. This theorem was originally developed based on a conjecture by Burnside, which asked whether finite simple groups of odd order exist.

Implicit versions of this method and its variations are used for stiff equations. It is a first-order Runge-Kutta method.

The most common form of this algorithm is its fourth-order variant, in which doubling the number of steps leads to a 16-fold reduction in error. This algorithm improves on the Taylor algorithm by not having to compute derivatives, and it begins with a calculation identical to the Euler method.

A sweep-line algorithm that accomplishes this process via a divide-and-conquer strategy with a computational complexity of O(n log n) was developed by Garey.

A graph is vertex transitive, if, for every pair of vertices, there exists one of these objects with a certain property. If the number of these operations for a field extension is equal to its degree, the extension is Galois.

A subgroup is characteristic if every one of these operations for the group maps the subgroup to itself. For a finite vector space, the group of these is the general linear group.

A vector on a Hilbert space is described by this term if there exists a bounded linear operator such that the orbits of the operator on the vector are dense in the Hilbert space. A group is called virtually this if it contains one of these groups, and that group has a nite number of cosets. For every n, there exists exactly one of these groups with n elements, and the only simple Abelian groups are the instances of these groups with non-composite order. These groups correspond to the rotational symmetries of a polygon. For ten points, identify this class of groups with one generator of which every element is a power.

Simon Stevin proved this result for polynomials by constructing the decimal expansion of a solution, and a function is said to be Darboux if it ful lls the property laid out in this result. Bolzano's theorem is equivalent to this result, which is true because continuous functions take connected sets to connected sets. This theorem fails to be true for the rationals because they are not con- nected; for example, although there exist rationals a,b such that a2 = 0 and b2 = 4, there exists no rational c such that c2 = 2.

One form of this quantity is de ned as the determinant of theshape operator and is named for Gauss.

If a patch is regular and has this property, then it maps its domain di eo- morphically onto its codomain.

A functor having this property on maps is called faithful, and if it has this property on objects as well, it is called an   embed- ding.

A way to prove this theorem is by constructing a nested sequence of closed spheres with radii converging to zero, which contains a single point, contradicting the terms of the construction.

Examining the spectrum of a quantization of the classical Hamiltonian “H equals xp” yields a result similar to this statement according to the Berry–Keating conjecture. This statement is implied by the stronger Mertens conjecture, which was proven to be false in 1985. Adolf Piltz formulated a “generalized” version of this statement that applies to Dirichlet (“DEE-ree-klet”) L-series, which reduces to the standard version when all terms in the series have numerator 1. This statement, which was introduced in the 1859 paper “On the Number of Primes Less Than a Given Magnitude,” would place a tight bound on the error term in the prime number theorem if it were true.

The “class equation” is a consequence of taking this function to be a conjugation that maps from a group G to itself. When G is performing this mapping on a set X, different orbits resulting from this mapping are disjoint, and the order of G is equal to “the order of the orbit of some element a in X” multiplied by “the order of the stabilizer of a.” For a group G and set X, every one of these functions of G on X induces a homomorphism from G into the symmetric group of X called a permutation representation. For 10 points, name these functions that take in a group element from G, and an element from set X, and output an element from set X.

For ordinary differential equations in the complex plane, if the order of the poles at a singular point are sufficiently small, the point has this property, and thus there is a solution that can be written as a power series.

In complex analysis, if there is an analytic continuation of a power series in a neighborhood of a point, then the point has this property. A closed set and a point not in that set can be (*) separated by neighborhoods in this kind of space, which the T3 axiom adds to a Hausdorff space.

George Odom showed how to obtain this number using an inscribed equilateral triangle by drawing a chord between the midpoints of two of its sides and extending it to meet the circle. When this number is used as a numerical base, every integer terminates, but every fraction is non-terminating; in that base, the digit sequence 11 (one-one) is avoided because it equals 100 (one-zero-zero). This number can be called “the most irrational” because each level of its continued fraction has the same largest magnitude of difference; in other words, its continued fraction has only ones in its denominators. Based on that, this number can be found algebraically by solving the equation “x equals one over the term one plus x.” By definition, the square of this number equals one plus itself.

This quantity is lowered by CUR approximations. In latent semantic analysis, choosing a smaller value for this quantity allows the approximation of an object that contains term frequencies for a given document.

The number of columns of a matrix is equal to the sum of the dimension of the null space and this quantity by the [this quantity]–nullity theorem.

By bounding the absolute value between two functions by an integrable function, a theorem named for this property can be proven using Fatou’s lemma. Differentiation under the integral sign can be proved using the mean value theorem followed by Lebesgue’s (“luh-BEG’s”) dominated [this property] theorem. Equicontinuity and being uniformly bounded is required for this property to hold for a group of values according to the Arzela–Ascoli theorem. Numbers denoted M-sub-n are considered in the (*) Weierstrass (“VYE-er-shtross”) M-test for this property, which Cauchy (“koh-SHEE”) sequences also have. In real analysis, the pointwise type of this property is weaker than the uniform type of this property. The alternating series test and ratio test are used to determine if a series has this property.

This operation can be performed on a complex function if both its real and imaginary parts are harmonic, or equivalently, that it satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations, a condition called holomorphicity.
