In the interline variety of these devices, readout occurs by shifting charge to a neighboring hidden column, while full-frame versions of these devices read out the entire data set at the same time, leading to longer readout times. Defects in these devices result in the spillover of charge into neighboring elements, a process known as "blooming," and the optimal dynamic range of these devices is limited by the existence of dark current. The operating principle of these devices is that an incoming photon excites an electron out of a charge well, allowing that electron to be read out; accordingly, these devices are characterized by their well depth and their pixels can be damaged via ionizing radiation. They are generally preferable in scientific applications to CMOS sensors because of their excellent quantum efficiency. For ten points, identify these semiconductor devices which are used heavily used in astronomical imaging.

One commander in this conflict dropped crash dummies with parachutes as part of Operation Magistral, which led to a heroic stand on Hill 3234. Tensions leading up to it were exacerbated by an incident in which Adolph Dubs was killed after a hostage standoff in a hotel by members of Setami Milli. This conflict saw the nefarious KHAD carry out a series of massacres at the Pul-e-Charkhi prison, and was partially triggered by the growing popularity of the Khalq Party. This effort was driven by hardware like the BMP-1, in which it exposed a serious chassis design flaw, and SU-25 Frogfoots based out of Bagram Air Base. It opened with with Storm-333, a furious assault by Alpha Group on the Tajbeg Palace that killed President Amin.

In the DisPerSE formalism developed by Sousbie, et. al. these structures are analogous to ascending 3-manifolds. Models in which these structures mimic dark energy acceleration have been proposed as alternatives to Lambda-CDM, but such models suffer from the fact that they violate homogeneity and require excessive fine-tuning. One of these structures found in the Eridanus constellation corresponds directly to the "cold spot" in the WMAP images, and that structure may have produced the aforementioned "cold spot" via a late-time integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect.

Its four subtypes include ip and R, in which the departure of the leaving group is rate-limiting. For aryl phenylacetates and other esters with acidic alpha-hydrogens, this mechanism is preferred over the Bac2 mechanism for acyl transfer. The transition from the enolate to the final product of the Knoevenagel reaction proceeds via this mechanism. Samarium oxide and other rare earth oxides are good catalysts for this mechanism, which is highly selective for the Hofmann orientation. In the final step of the Robinson annulation, the transition between the beta-hydroxyketone and the alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone is a dehydration that follows this mechanism. Reactions of alkyl halides proceed via this mechanism if the leaving group is two carbons away from a carbonyl group. It usually takes place in a strong base, and in this mechanism, the departure of the leaving group occurs after a charged intermediate is generated by the abstraction of a proton.

This king entertained the monk Rabban Bar Sauma at his court, and was sent a letter by Arghun of the Ilkhanate which promised to bestow Jerusalem upon him - in return, he sent his own diplomat Gobert de Helleville, but he never formed the anticipated alliance with the Mongols. After he personally led his army to victory at Mons-en-Pevele, he forced the Treaty of Athis-sur-Orge upon Robert III, the Count of Flanders. He established the Chamber of Accounts to manage financial matters and widely diffused gold coinage. Prior to the above treaty, his army was routed at the Battle of the Golden Spurs, sometimes referred to as Courtrai. This ruler's aide Guillaume de Nogaret is often given credit for conducting the trial of Jacques de Molay, and for being the one who slapped a certain figure, leading to the bull "Unam sanctam."

Act IV of this play sees a king argue that art is needed to "mend nature," an aesthetic position his daughter rejects by stating that "were [she] painted" with make-up, she wouldn't want her prince to choose her to "breed by" for that reason. A dispute between the shepherdesses Mopsa and Dorcas leads a clown to exclaim "Is there no manners left among maids?" That dispute is partly based on the shepherdesses' desire to publish some ballads, one of which is advertised as "very true, and but a month old." The line "You pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely" is uttered by the king's counselor Camillo.

All closed irreducible atoroidal 3-manifolds with infinite fundamental group admit this type of metric by Thurston's geometrization conjecture. Mostow rigidity states that given a homotopy equivalence f between closed manifolds of this type with dimension greater than 2, f is homotopic to an isometry. This type of manifold has constant negative curvature -1 and has as its universal cover this type of space. Models of this space include the Klein model and the Poincare half-plane model. In this type of space, given any line l and point p not on l, there are infinitely many lines passing through p and not intersecting l, and the three angles in a triangle always sum up to less than 180 degrees.

An exotic version of this type of space, homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic to the standard type, was constructed by Milnor in dimension 7. All of these spaces can be realized as iterated suspensions of the space of two points. The Hopf fibration exhibits a covering of a 2-dimensional one by a 3-dimensional one whose fiber is a 1-dimensional one of these. The Poincare-Hopf degree theorem says that maps from a manifold to one of these are classified up to homotopy by their degree, and a standard example of such a map is the Gauss map. Smale demonstrated that a two-dimensional one can be turned inside out without forming creases in this type of eversion. In 3 dimensions the Poincare conjecture states that every simply-connected closed manifold is homeomorphic to one of these.

Detailed measurements of this phenomenon have been made by Barber and Putterman by measuring Mie [MEE] scattering.  Most scientists have rejected Julian Schwinger's explanation of this in terms of emission of zero-point energy.  The first experimental observation of this process was made in 1934 by Frenzel and Schultes, and interest in this effect was renewed by a discovery of a special form of it in 1990 by Felipe Gaitan. The Taleyarkhan group claims to have generated nuclear fusion via this process.

The Drosophila X virus is thought to trigger this pathway as a means of innate immunity. This pathway is responsible for guiding H3K9 methylation in the centromeric regions of S. Cerevisiae.

The avian sarcoma virus genome codes for protein p47, which has a high degree of homology to this enzyme. Its activity is stimulated by gustducin, and this protein's gamma subtype is phosphorylated by T-cell receptors. Aluminum toxicity in plants occurs in response to inhibition of this enzyme. It is activated via stimulation of its SH2 domain, subsequently activating protein kinase C in many cases. This protein can disrupt the GPI anchors that attach membrane proteins to the lipid bilayer.

Chapter 16 of Peter Bernstein's Against the Gods discusses the formation and development of this theory, which is often represented by a graph that rapidly increases in the fourth quadrant but flattens out in the first quadrant. One example of this concept, which can be avoided by hedonic framing, is the disposition effect, which occurs when investors tend to sell assets that have appreciated but hold those that have depreciated.
