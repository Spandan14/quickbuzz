When these particles are restricted to move in two-dimensional periodic potential under the influence ofa magnetic field, their energy spectrum is a Cantor set, which is known as Hofstadter's butterfly.

Einstein formulated a statistical correction to this law that incorporates a coefficient to account for the probability of a solid oscillator having a certain frequency. Peter Debye later improved on Einstein's result by modeling the internal energy of a solid as residing in oscillations of the whole solid and not in individual atoms. Deviations from this law occur at low temperature because the spacing between energy levels is large compared to the product of the Boltzmann constant and the absolute temperature, so it is forbidden to possess energies above the zero-point energy. One can derive this result from classical physics by assuming that each atom in a solid has three translational and three vibrational degrees of freedom and then applying the equipartition theorem. For 10 points, identify this law which states that the specific heat capacity of every solid is three times the ideal gas constant.

A coherent form of this phenomenon is impossible in media with a refractive index of unity, ruling out masers based on it in a vacuum. When the ratio of energy loss via inverse Compton emission to energy loss via this phenomenon is greater than 1, it results in the “inverse Compton catastrophe”, which puts a brightness limit on stationary sources of it. This phenomenon undergoes self-absorption past the peak of its spectrum, which occurs at point two nine times the critical frequency. In an astrophysical plasma whose plasma frequency is greater than this phenomenon’s frequency divided by gamma, this phenomenon is suppressed in the (*) Razin effect. The degree of polarization of this phenomenon is equal to the spectral index plus 1 over the spectral index plus 5/3. This phenomenon typically displays a steep negative spectral index. This phenomenon displays beaming in a cone of width of one over gamma, and follows a continuous power-law distribution across a broad range of frequencies.

This approach can be used to find the Rabi formula and the rate of spontaneous emission when applied to a forced two-level system. The interaction representation has to be used alongside this method to calculate the time-propagator when the system is time-dependent. When applying this method to a (*) degenerate state, a re-diagonalization of a certain operator in terms of degenerate states is required to solve the vanishing denominator problem; that method is used when this method is applied to the linear Stark effect.

The time of flight of an object whose trajectory is this shape is related to the true anomaly of an orbit by Barker's Equation.

An astronomical body whose orbit is this shape has a characteristic energy of (*) zero. James Gregory realized that spherical and chromatic aberrations in Newtonian telescopes could be reduced by adding "reflectors" named for this two-dimensional shape.

These systems can be simplified by using an effective potential equal to the gravitational potential plus a term proportional to the quantity “a minus b cosine theta squared, all over sine squared theta,” where “a” and “b” are two constants of the motion. Felix Klein and Arnold Sommerfeld collaborated on a four-volume set of lecture notes titled The Theory of these systems. Systems of this type partially filled with liquid can become unstable as they make small deviations from their “sleeping” position. The third integrable system of this type to be discovered was found by Sofia Kovalevskaya (koh-vah-lev-SKY-ah) and has two of the principal moments of inertia equal to twice the third. The downward pull of gravity on these systems induces a torque that causes precession and nutation of their rotational axes, and sliding friction can cause the “tippe” kind to flip upside down.

In this formalism, as the size parameter increases, the forward lobe becomes significantly larger than the backward lobe. In general, this theory does not assume that the internal fields are quasi-static.

This model assumes that the spin-orbit coupling is always analogous to jj coupling such that the individual particle l and s numbers add vectorially. The strongest success of this model is its explanation of the high neutron cross section and natural abundance of isotopes and isotones with 28, 50, or other “magic numbers” of nucleons, thus improving on the older liquid-drop model.

When deriving the most general model satisfying this condition, one enforces the lack of a conical singularity, therefore eliminating an 'A over r' term in the denominator. The fact that cosmological matter fields are assumed to obey this condition implies they can be modelled as perfect fluids, as they have diagonal stress-energy tensors. Assuming this condition allows one to pull an 'a of t all squared' factor out of the spatial components of a metric, leading to the derivation of the Robertson-Walker metric, the most general one to obey this condition. As well as spatial homogeneity, the cosmological principle states that the universe has this property on large scales. WMAP showed that the CMBR does not exactly have this property in some regions.

Diffraction patterns always have a form of this property due to Friedel's law. In one or two dimensions, if this property is continuous, it must persist under short-range interactions and finite temperatures, according to the Mermin-Wagner theorem. If this property did not persist, the correlation function for the corresponding Goldstone boson would diverge. The existence of this property for the weak force implies that the W and Z bosons should be massless, which is why the Higgs mechanism locally violates this property. Noether's (NUR-tehr's) first theorem states that for each one of these properties that is differentiable, there exists a corresponding conservation law. Spontaneous breaking of this property can solve the hierarchy problem, which is why some propose this property for bosons and fermions.
