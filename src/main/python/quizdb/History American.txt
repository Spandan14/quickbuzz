Monkhouse Davison was one victim of this event, for which he claimed 480 pounds restitution. The instigators of this event sought to have certain "consignees" excluded, as they had been in other cities, in one case after a protest led by Benjamin Rush. But since those consignees included the sons of Thomas Hutchinson, they received official protection where this event took place. The legislation that provoked this event did not lift the (*) Townshend duty, proceeds of which were used to pay royal officials, though this event can be interpreted as the action of a supply-restricting cartel since that legislation granted the East India Company the right to export directly to the colonies. That legislation gave rise to two specific grievances motivating this event: that it created officials who were loyal to the crown rather than the colonial assembly, and that it amounted to unconstitutional taxation without representation. For 10 points, name this 1773 event, which consisted of the cargo of the Dartmouth, Eleanor, and Beaver being thrown overboard.

Edwin Meese tacitly argued in favor of this doctrine by attacking Cooper v. Aaron, a 1958 case which struck down one instance of this doctrine: a move to delay desegregation in Little Rock, Arkansas.

This legislation was repealed by the Wheeler-Howard Act, which in turn gave rise to the Supreme Court case Carcieri v. Salazar. That case found that a measure taken to reverse the effect of this legislationÂ—the creation of land trusts--was unconstitutional if it had been done after 1934. Senator Henry Teller, a former Secretary of the Interior, opposed this legislation, saying "if this were done in the name of greed, it would be bad enough; but to do it in the name of humanity...is infinitely worse."

Another trial resulting from this event ended in the deaths of William French and Daniel Houghton in the Westminster Massacre. This event occurred because of George III's decision in the Boundary Order in Council of July 20, 1764, which nullified land patents issued by Benning Wentworth. The dispute which arose from this event was the result of Charles II's original awarding of territory to his brother, James, Duke of York, in 1664, which established the eastern boundary of those territories at the Connecticut River.

One account of the mission to survey a boundary between these two colonies included nicknames for figures, like Shoebrush for John Lovick and Plausible for Edward Mosely; that work is The Secret History of the Dividing Line Betwixt these two colonies by William Byrd. The need for a survey resulted, in part, from two contrary descriptions of the northern boundary of one colony in two charters in 1663 and 1665, the latter of which establishes the northern end of Currituck Inlet, a body connected to Albemarle Sound, as the marker for the boundary.

These groups “perpetually pass into one another,” like “fluid” that “hardens to solid” and “solid” that “rushes to fluid,” in a passage stating that they represent “two sides of the great radical dualism.” The claim that there is no “mind” distinctive to one of these groups, just as there is no such “liver,” is found in an 1898 study of the “economic relation” between these groups “as a factor in social evolution.” A long essay originally serialized in the Dial under a title describing a “great lawsuit” involving these two groups is titled for one of them “in the 19th century.” Margaret Fuller and Charlotte Perkins Gilman wrote essays about relations between, for 10 points, what two groups, which were “created equal” according to the Declaration of Sentiments written at the Seneca Falls Convention?

A 1971 book on a type of this process assessed successes and failures to “definitive,” “purposeful,” “catalytic,” and “expressive” actions and was written by James Cable.
