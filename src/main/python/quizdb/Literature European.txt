This concept expresses the idea of an “estranged world” ruled by an ominous “it” according to Wolfgang Kayser’s study of it in art and literature. This concept gave “Satan his horns, his cloven foot, and his bat’s wings” in the “popular traditions of the Middle Ages” according to an essay that calls it a “principle unknown to the ancients.” A book suggests the “Indian Wonders” tales as one source for the image of a “body” with this quality, which is “not separated from the rest of the world” and has “apertures and convexities” that are emphasized. Drama created by the combination of this quality with the sublime is called a poetry “born of Christianity” in Victor Hugo’s preface to Cromwell.
