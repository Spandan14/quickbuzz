The author of this work speaks of "the woman-god [who] demands our veneration, the god-like woman [who] kindles our love" while describing a statue which he believes represents Juno Ludovisi. One section of this work argues that only the title kind of "disposition of the soul," gives birth to liberty, pointing out that "the delightfull flower... will never unfold itself in the case of the Troglodyte." The 19th section of this work distinguishes between two different states of passive and active capacity, arguing that the opposition between those states "preserves an entire freedom between them both," while earlier, the author postulates a dialectic between the sensuous drive and the formal drive. This work's last section advocates a "dynamic state of rights of man," which leads to the "realm of the beautiful," in which man appears to man, "only... as an object of free play." For ten points, identify this series of epistles on the philosophy of art, written to the author's patron, the Duke of Augustenberg by Friedrich Schiller.

In one work, this man uses tailor swatches to explain his idea of "exemplification," in which objects both represents a predicate and also possess it. That same work claims that paintings are "syntactically unlimited and semantically dense" because of the multiplicity of meaning in both the marks on the paper and what they could possibly refer to. This philosopher renounced the concept of abstract entities with Quine in "Steps Toward a Constructive Nominalism" and formulated a "calculus of simplicity" in his essay "On the Theory of Systems," the first chapter of his The Structure of Appearance. Another of his works opens an essay on "The Problem of Counterfactual Conditionals," and develops the theory of projection. In that work, he argued that the choice of predicate bases could not be explained by Hume's method of basing induction in repetition, and that coming up with rules equivalent to laws of deductive logic for induction was the "new riddle of induction." For 10 points, name this author of Language of Art and Fact, Fiction and Forecast who formulated the grue-bleen paradox.

This practice had an analog in the cult of Cybele's practice of taurobolium, and this practice is advocated by the Right Ginza in Mandeism, which follows this action with a sacred meal. A reference to this practice "for the dead," is contained in 1 Corinthians 15:29, in which it is asked "if there is no resurrection, what will those do," to whom this has happened. That practice may originate in the rituals of the Orphic cult, which carried out this action to prepare their dead for the underworld. According to the Arians and the Donatists, this action was only efficacious if performed by someone who was of pure intention and belonged to the church, while leaders like Conrad Grebel and Felix Mantz argued that only an adult could undergo this ritual and denied its usefulness to infants. This practice is generally considered the first sacrament in Catholicism. Taking its name from the Greek for "to immerse," for ten points, identify this action which was performed for Jesus by John, and which involves annointment with water, symbolizing entry to the faith.

This author's feud with Rufus Griswold led Griswold to write a vituperative biography about him. He was known as the "tomahawk man" because of his devastating critical reviews in magazines such as Godey's Lady's Book. This author claimed that poems which preached morality committed the "heresy of the didactic," and argued that short stories and poems should be short enough to be read in one sitting in order to produce a "single effect" on the reader. He satirized the Transcendentalists as "Frogpondians," and sparked a controversy by accusing Henry Wadsworth Longfellow of plagiarism in 1845. This author called the death of a beautiful woman "the most poetical topic in the world" in an essay outlining his systematic planning of one of his poems, which repeats a single-word refrain to create a melancholy tone. He outlined his literary ideas in essays such as "The Poetic Principle" and "The Philosophy of Composition." For 10 points, name this author of "The City in the Sea" and "The Raven."

One work by this thinker considers "broken" and "unbroken" myths while discussing the limits of the "conventional," or rigid, form of the titular concept. This thinker noted that scriptural literalism requires as much conjecture as the work of David Strauss in his appeal to supplant the cultural identity of Christ in favor of a "New Being." His best known work identifies meaninglessness as the culprit behind the present "age of anxiety" and closes by observing that the title concept is rooted "in the God who appears when God has disappeared." This author of The Dynamics of Faith more centrally described a question-and-answer relationship to explain how divine revelation serves as an inextricable counterpart to ontology in his three-volume Systematic Theology.

Derek Pereboom has developed a so-called "Four-Case" argument against this philosophical position. Peter Strawson argued for this philosophical doctrine on the basis of resentment by analyzing the psychological impossibility of abandoning reactive attitudes. John Martin Fischer advocates a "semi-" version of this philosophical position by denying the "principle of transfer of blamelessness" in fail-safe situations, while Harry Frankfurt argued for this philosophical position in a 1969 paper by denying the Principle of Alternative possibilities. Daniel Dennet argued for this position by positing the possibility of constructing a deterministic deliberator in his book Elbow Room, and in general arguments for this position affirm the possibility of assigning moral responsibility despite the fact that every event is causally determined by previous events.

Anne Anastasi wrote a major 1954 text about these entities, and was known as the "guru" of them. Alan and Nadeen Kaufman used the CHC model to develop several of these entities, including the KABC and the KAIT. Robert Sternberg developed his triarchic theory because of his concerns that these entities are dissociated from the real world. Louis Thurstone applied multiple-factor analysis to these entities, causing him to posit seven "primary abilities." Many of them, such as Raven's Progressive Matrices, are based on Charles Spearman's concept of a general factor, or g. Stephen Jay Gould argued that the hereditarian interpretation of these entities in The Bell Curve promoted scientific racism in The Mismeasure of Man.

The most famous member of this group divided atheism into hylozoic, hylopatian, and cosmo-plastic variants, and argued that the so-called "Plastick Nature" of life was the medium by which God made his presence known in his creation. The work in which that philosophy is contained is entitled The True Intellectual System of the Universe, and other works by members of this group include A Discourse of the Freedom of the Will by Peter Sterry and the Aphorisms of Benjamin Whitcote.

This work defines its central concept as a group of citizens "united... by some common impulse," and argues that the two methods of "curing the mischief" of such groups are to remove its causes and control its effects. Addressed to the people of New York by James Madison writing as "Publius," this work concludes by arguing that the advantage enjoyed by a republic over a democracy is likewise enjoyed by a large republic over a small one.

In the 1980s, Jeffrey Alexander relaxed this perspective's traditional assumptions to develop a "neo" version of it. Gabriel Almond adapted this perspective to political science in order to compare different political systems. An influential version of this perspective analyzed systems using five pairs of "pattern variables" such as "diffuseness and specificity" and "ascription and achievement." An essay by Kingsley Davis and Wilbur Moore used this perspective to propose a positive model of social stratification. This perspective dominated American sociology from the 1930s to the 1970s in part because it was supported by the theories of Robert Merton and Talcott Parsons. It considers society to be a biological organism consisting of interrelated parts.

One method for solving this problem relies on Chothia's finiteness hypothesis, and the CASP studies are conducted to evaluate different methods of solving this problem. In one approach to this problem, the frozen approximation is employed to simplify pairwise comparisons. In another, each position in the target is assigned to one of eighteen environmental classes based on criteria such as degree of exposure; both of these approaches are types of threading. Many programs used for this application, such as Rosetta, use rotamer libraries to simplify conformation sampling. The basic approaches to this problem are ab initio modeling, homology modeling, and fold recognition. This procedure has been straightforward for targets like GCN4, which contains a coiled coil, but can be more difficult for subjects with membrane-spanning domains.

Buckley, inspiring Charles Hamilton Houston to develop a strategy to fight them. After these policies were ruled not binding on their members, they were largely replaced by the strategy of blockbusting. The 1945 study Black Metropolis argues that these policies are responsible for preserving the ghetto. Horace Cayton claimed that at their height, they covered eighty percent of Chicago.

One story about this figure relates how he supposedly obtained the Perfection of Wisdom texts from the king of the nagas in exchange for teaching the king his philosophy. A central concept in this thinker's philosophy is the notion of pratitya-samutpada, or "interdependence," which characterizes conventional reality, and he advocated mahakaruna, or "great compassion," as a means of transcending samsara. According to this thinker, the true cause of suffering was ignorance, which could be overcome through the realization of the anatman, or "no-self," and he argued that in order to have svabhava, or "essence," a thing must have a non-relational identify. Since nirvana is conceived of in opposition to samsara, this thinker argued that nirvana was not utimately real, and neither is anything else, and advocated that ignorance be counteracted through meditations on sunyata, or emptiness.

This work twice quotes Holderlin to say "But where danger is, grows the saving power also," and once more to remind us that "poetically dwells man upon this earth," linking the poetical to the ekphanestaton of Plato's Phaedrus. According to this work, the essence of the title concept lies in Enframing, and the etymology of the title concept as a term "for the arts of the mind," is explored in connection to the episteme, leading to the statement that the title concept is a mode of revealing. As an example of the titular concept, this essay presents the "monstrousness" of a hydroelectric power plant situated on the Rhine, and it concludes with the statement that because of our preoccupation with the title concept, "we no longer guard and preserve the coming to presence of art."

These entities are said to "have no windows through which something can enter or leave," explaining why they can be entered by "neither substance nor accident." The work that introduced these entities created a synchronous pre-established harmony between "the kingdom of final causes" and that of efficient causes. Their chief proponent gave them a three-part hierarchy, from spirits to souls to entelechies, and he described them as combining the merits of mathematical and physical points, being able to be both real and exact.

This book calls the practice of making items for one's own use "house-holding," which is grouped as one of three precursors to modern society along with systems based on redistribution and reciprocity. It asserts that society was forced to make a "protectionist countermove" after the disastrous attempts to maintain the international gold standard, which was previously one of the foundations for a self-regulating economy and the rise of a market society.

David Kaplan presented a theory of these philosophical ideas in a lecture later published as "Dthat" shortly after they were formally introduced in a lecture series by their best-known popularizer. One of the uses of these philosophical concepts is to demonstrate the existence of necessary a posteriori propositions and contingent a priori propositions, and the inventor of this term proposed that proper names and natural kinds such as water are examples of these.

The "enactments" written as a result of applying this concept are called taqqanot, while decrees issued pursuant to this concept are called gezerot. The development of this concept was initiated by the "splendid ones," or ge'onim, who were supplanted by ri'shonim such as Shelomoh Yitzhaki, or Rashi. Modern codification of this concept was undertaken by Yosef Karo with the publication of the Shulchan arukh, while the major geonic codification of it is the Mishneh Torah of Maimonides.

One chapter of this work claims that without some "insignificant ornament" such as a "haunch button," a suit of clothes is in want of something. That chapter cites the customs of cranial deformation among Native Americans and foot-binding among the Chinese to define the influence of "custom" and "fashion" on the subject of this work. The author of this work argues that it would be wrong for men to not treat women with "pleasantry, and attention" in a discussion of sex as one of the "passions which take their origins from the body," as opposed to the social, unsocial, and selfish passions. The second of this work's six parts discusses "merit and demerit," whereas the opening portion describes human judgment with respect to adversity and propriety. Extensively discussing the "sympathy" that has men rejoice in the joys of others and feel sorrow at others' sorrows, this work elucidates the "nature" and "motive" of morality, splitting from its author's mentor at the University of Glasgow, Francis Hutcheson.

One method of generating one of these constructs is to use Thompson's Construction to create an intermediate structure, then construct the power set of those states. Every "intrinsic," or "minimal" one of these structures has an associated syntactic monoid, and these constructs are classified as either Moore or Mealy types depending on what sort of function gives their output. The Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm generates one of these constructs, which it uses to perform a string search. A set of symbols that brings one of these to an accepting state is said to belong to its language, and it is impossible to construct one of these objects, which does not accept a regular language as a consequence of the Pumping Lemma. These objects are formally defined by specifying a finite alphabet, a set of states, and a transition function between those states. For 10 points, name this theoretical construct, often used to model simple aspects of computing.

One work once attributed to this philosopher pairs the title concepts with modi intelligendi and modi essendi, or modes of understanding and modes of being, positing a triadic relationship between word, concept, and being. Because of this misattribution, C.S. Peirce attributes the project of grammatica speculativa or "pure grammar" to this philosopher, and Heidegger's habilitation dissertation is mistakenly titled after this philosopher's theory of categories and meaning. It turns out that he didn't write De modis significandi by Thomas of Erfurt, but he did introduce the concept of a non-qualitative property responsible for individuation, a haecceity. He argued against the notion that certainty depends upon an uncreated exemplar, the divine illumination of Henry of Ghent, and he wrote commentaries on Porphyry's Isagoge and Aristotle's Categories. For 10 points, identify this scholastic philosopher who wrote the Ordinatio and who was nicknamed Doctor Subtilis.

Another section differentiates between the religious man who is concerned with eternity and the rebel who lives in the present world. This work analyzes Don Juan as an example of the seducer, which is compared with the actor and the conqueror as archetypes of how a man could live. This work begins by asking how one decides not to commit suicide to explain why man must face the absurdity of life, and it claims the title mythological figure represents the human condition as he eternally rolls a rock up a hill.

One of this thinker's works contains a "notorious paragraph" about a proposition that is simultaneously true and unprovable. Tom Stoppard based his fictional Dogg language on a scenario created by this man in which a builder asks another man to hand him materials, but "brick" actually means "here" and "cube" means "thank you". That idea is discussed in a work that distinguishes between "seeing as" and "seeing that" through the example of a "duckrabbit".

The ninth section outlines three types of friendship claiming friendships based on utility or pleasure will dissolve. It uses the example of an archer who must aim between two extremes to demonstrate the doctrine of the mean. This book cites practical judgment called "phronesis" as one of the five intellectual virtues the soul needs to find truth.

This book distinguishes between general jealousy towards all richer social classes and particular jealously towards an individual in its section "The Problem of Envy." This work's second part concludes with a section "The Role of Civil Disobedience" and the title of the first chapter equates the title concept with fairness. Allowing inequalities in the distribution of goods only if it will benefit the needy is called the difference principle, which was countered by the entitlement theory in a notable critique. This work discusses the "original position" in which people decide society's principles unaware of their social position blinded by a "veil of ignorance."

In 1938, a controvery emerged over whether this system was plagiarized from the earlier Regula mastri, with even its defenders admitting that this code took much from the writings of John Cassian. This code suggests that the guest master and the cellarer be appointed unilaterally and bars all private property without exception. Though its author was the target of a poisoning by a disgruntled subject of this code, it in fact relaxed earlier extremes by proscribing eight hours of sleep, no additional fast times, and climate-appropriate clothing. It was written by a man who was the twin brother of St. Scholastica and imposed it on Monte Cassino.

One section of this work calls for a modern Socrates to teach society how little it actually knows, while earlier it claims Christianity is founded on the "absurd" idea that humans can have an individual relationship with God. It discusses a concept's unconscious form deriving from "ignorance" and its two conscious types deriving from "weakness" and "defiance." Its first section examines a man who believes "Caesar or nothing" and it takes its title from a passage from the Gospel of John about Lazarus. This work claims believing Christians are the only people exempt from the title condition and asserts that religious writing should act as a physician working at man's deathbed.

In a work about its "genesis and structure," Jean Hippolyte argued that this work is a bildungsroman. This work considers the ethical roles of the brother-sister relationship in a section about the "Ethical Order" of the title concept. Its preface explains that philosophers must "look purely" at consciousness in a method called "zusehen." The subsection "Independent and Dependent Self-Consciousness" argues that two consciousnesses can only define themselves by playing the roles of lord and bondsman to each other. This work explores the relationship of self-consciousness and "Absolute Knowledge" and discusses the master-slave dialectic.

The Downsian model of this practice uses an expected-utility theorem to describe its likelihood. Riker and Ordeshook described a theory on the "calculus" of this practice, deriving an equation that added a "D" term to include its "intrinsic benefits." Morris Fiorina described the "retrospective" type of this practice as opposed to its prospective variety, while Duncan Black created a theory explaining how targeting the "median" practitioner of this action can create a Nash equilibrium. One potential problem for the legitimacy of this practice concerns how society can have cyclical preferences despite individuals maintaining their transitive preferences as outlined in Condorcet's paradox.

August Rehberg critiqued this concept claiming attempts to link it with "the principle of equality" did not mean that all members of society have equal rights. Its creator distinguished it from similar "problematic" and "assertoric" ones. The opening of Mill's Utilitarianism explains that this concept was born from consequentialist considerations and offers no help for someone faced with conflicting duties. The originator of this doctrine clarified that following it makes one a member of "the kingdom of ends." Adherence to it ends the "failure to cultivate one's talents" and prevents anyone from lying.

He returned to Morocco with his monograph on Ibn Khaldun collected in his book Muslim Society. He argued that three spheres of human activity which he dubbed cognition, coercion, and production were in an unusual and favorable condition prior to birth of industrial society - those processes are symbolized by the title ideas in his work Plough, Sword, and Book. Another work contains a foreword by Bertrand Russell and was notably hated by Gilbert Ryle, who refused to review it in Mind, because of its "critical account of linguistic philosophy."

An article titled after this objective argues for it by inventing the word "teavy" and posing the question "is this table teavy?." That article defends this position by claiming that "the expression of attitude" is best achieved by art and poetry, but not by confusing the domain of science with artistic expression - an error which Nietzsche avoids. The author argues that this is necessary by stating that there are two kinds of pseudo-statements - ones which contain a word erroneously believed to have meaning, and ones where constituent words are meaningful but put together in a "counter-syntactical way." Another book's first chapter is titled after this - that chapter considers the similar phrases "Martyrs suffer" and "Martyrs exist," and contrasts them with the phrases "dogs are faithful" and "unicorns are fictitious." The aforementioned article by Rudolf Carnap argues for this "Through Logical Analysis of Language", while the verification principle is used to argue for this in the first chapter of Language, Truth, and Logic.

He claims that modernity led to the "myth functioning as a memory" of rural places as exemplars of a lost golden age. This author of The Country and the City also wrote a treatise on television that terms a network's attempt to keep its viewers watching from program-to-program as "flow."

That poem begins "The god/Is near and hard to grasp" and imagines the epiphany of the Book of Revelations to John. In another poem, this author wonders "who wants poets at all in lean years," a line which prompted the essay "What Are Poets For?" by Heidegger. Along with "Patmos," he wrote a verse tragedy in which the title philosopher sees himself as a man of purity in a world of men who have lost connection to nature.

The subject of this work wrote that God had given man two books: the Bible and a metaphorical book of animals, Nature itself. This work was inspired by its author's reading of the tract Natural Theology or the Book of Creatures, written by the title Spanish theologian.

The scientist that first proposed this theory described it as explaining the way that trophic energy is a major controller of life. Graham Bell expanded this theory to also explain why some organisms use meiosis to only pass on half of their individual genes to their offspring. An example of this would be the natural selection of foxes that run fast enough to catch rabbits, and the subsequent selection of rabbits that are able to outrun those faster foxes. This theory was proposed by Leigh Van Valen to explain that because evolution of one species may result in the extinction of another, both species must be constantly evolving in order to stay extant.

This concept is a feature of matching models, in which it gives mathematical meaning to intuitive notions of the "thick market," where the benefits of trading are greater the larger the number of potential counter-parties with whom to trade. One well-known application of this concept is Krugman's 1991 paper entitled "[This concept] and Economic Geography," in which it is used to explain why economic activity in a sector or industry concentrates in particular locations when locations are identical ex-ante. This concept usually enters models through a fixed cost of production, which along with monopolistic competition gives firms market power and non-zero profits. This concept is in general rejected by data on economy-, industry-, and firm-level production, which produce parameter estimates closer to Cobb-Douglas, so its use is disputed despite that models which assume this are successful.

In the canonical DMP model, this endogenous object is determined as the solution to a Nash bargaining problem. As such, it varies too much as Shimer pointed out, resulting in the empirical puzzle of unemployment that is not sufficiently counter-cyclical. Bewley published a subjective study of the empirical "stickiness" of this value, which provides some support to theoretical departures from traditional bilateral efficiency. In the models by Shapiro and Stiglitz, this value is higher than it would be in the absence of shirking, resulting in the so-called "efficiency" one of these.

Examples of this concept in action include the Rat Race, in which agents expend resources on some task that fails to distinguish their type because not doing so would reveal themselves unfavorably. In that case, signaling does not support a separating equilibrium. Another example of this concept is the insurance market of Rothschild and Stiglitz, in which agents with differing probabilities of illness are screened by an insurer. In that case, a pooling equilibrium is pareto-superior to a separating one but vulnerable to cream-skimming. A third example is an asset market in which the seller is better-informed about the asset's value, and though the buyer would be willing to transact for any known asset value, the seller's superior knowledge dissuades the buyer from any proposal.

This work posited a distinction between "the satisfying and the satisfactory" and discusses Bergson's comparison of the Parthenon's frieze with the models it depicts to assert that the Greeks privileged the climactic moment of change.  In "The Play of Ideas" it asserts the limitations of an aesthetic stance by providing the example of a visitor to a foreign country who cannot understand why beautifully designed articles are used for instrumental purposes, thus degrading their inherent nature.  It ends with a chapter titled "The Copernican Revolution," which explores how the scientific method has resolved the opposition between theory and practice.  Subtitled, "A Study of the Relation Between Knowledge and Action," it was based on its author's 1929 Gifford Lectures and argues for a pragmatic approach to philosophy's titular search for truth.

His doctorate examined the concept of capitalism in German scholarship, while during World War II he wrote a series of important monographs on the sociology of Nazism, arguing that they sought to overthrow the enlightenment. He called the gratification of emotions "affectivity", which he contrasted with a state of "affective neutrality."  He differentiated between societies that valued action in the correct context versus advancement per se, a distinction he dubbed ascription and achievement. His educational theories emphasized people finding their appropriate occupation in society, an idea that with his students Davis and Moore became the theory of role allocation. His explication of the nature of illness in chapter 10 of The Social System was one of the founding texts of medical sociology.

The earliest explorations of this philosophical property are attributed to Eubulides of Miletus.  One modern attempt to deal with this property adheres to the principle of least mutiliation and rejecting the notion of bivalent truth; this view is known as "supervaluation."  Another approach to considering this property, called epistemicism, holds that there is some cutoff that is fundamentally unknowable. That view was advanced in Timothy Williamson's book on this property, which asserted that "no one knows whether I am thin."  Responsible for the sorities paradox or the paradox of the heap, for 10 points, identify this property defined by C.S. Peirce as what happens when a concept's meaning is intrinsically uncertain.

He championed the concept of the sensus literalis rather than the doctrine of the four senses championed by the Scholastics.  His lectures to visiting Hungarians on Sundays and Feast days were the origin of his namesake "Homilies."  He opposed the ideas of Karlstadt and argued for a spiritual sense of duty or righteous conscience.  He helped edit The Letters of Obscure Men, a satire against his granduncle Johann Reuchlin's ecclesiastical enemies.  Known by the epithet, Praeceptor Germaniae, his work Common Topics in Theology was an extensive formulation of Protestant doctrine.

With Michael Smith and Mark Johnston he advanced a meta-ethical theory holding that something is valued if, and only if, we would be disposed to value it under ideal circumstances.  He explored what it meant to introduce a new theoretical term into science in such papers as "Tensing the Copula" and "Void and Object."  This process, called Ramseyfication, was also employed in his, "An Argument for Identity Theory," to make a case for mind-brain monism.  He asserted the importance of tracing local matters of particular fact, a metaphysical doctrine that he called "Humean supervenience," and employed techniques from game-theory to describe norms as resulting from coordination problems in his first work, Convention.

Other important unpublished works by him include a work on the theory of R.G. Collingwood as well as an algebraic proof of Godel's incompleteness theorem. His 1982 work on Philosophical  Investigations provided the most comprehensive account of Wittgenstein's account of rules and private language.  His best-known work uses the example of the possibility of heating or cooling a meter stick to demonstrate that the statement that one meter is equal to the length of a meter stick is false in some possible worlds.

This work describes how one gains experience from creating a unity out of a manifold, and it presents time and space as the two pure forms of intuition. Of quantity, of quality, of relation, and of modality are the divisions into which this work places the twelve categories of understanding. It attempts to establish the necessity of certain propositions through the transcendental ideas.

Quine's essay "Epistemology Naturalized" contrasts Hume's language theories with those of this philosopher, who emphasized the importance of paraphrasis, or contextual definition, and translating whole sentences containing abstract terms to show the meaning of the terms without identifying corresponding objects.  In addition to that "theory of fictions", this philosopher distinguished between positive and negative acts and attacked theories of natural rights for relying on normative principles.  His first book addressed Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England, and another work by this philosopher contrasts social and hedonic calculations of the aggregate and individual forms of a quantity central to his "greatest happiness principle".

The fact that jade fragments into jadeite and nephrite, thus failing the nomicness test of projectibility is one objection to this philosophical position articulated by Jaegwon Kim, and Kim also argued that this theory forces recourse to "structure specific bridge laws" and "local reductions." One philosopher formulated this theory as a response to Ernest Nagel's "intertheoretic account", and that philosopher also used this theory to show that physicalist type identity theories are not sufficiently abstract, unlike functionalist ones. Besides Jerry Fodor, another supporter of this position used the existence of pain in a wide variety of species to show that the correspondence between mental and neural kinds posited by "brain state theory" was untenable. Developed by Hilary Putnam, for ten points, name this philosophical position arguing that a psychological kind can correspond to many possible physical kinds.

He argued against corporeal resurrection by comparing it to the transformation of iron into a garment. He used a fourfold structure of three maqam, one of which is split into two maslak, to present an occasionalist defense of the possibility of miracles in the seventeenth section of one work; that occasionalist position was tribute to his teacher al-Juwaynii, an Asharite.

Early in this work, the author distinguishes between Gluck and Gluckseligheit, though he concludes that neither can be universally valid as both rest on solely empirical principles. That discussion serves to explain the various characterizations of the "sensuous impulse" and deduces that moral law cannot contradict itself by abrogating the justifications of that impulse. In a section titled, "Deduction of Religion in General," the author requires that God produce a "complete congruency" between the moral law and the happiness of finite rational beings, asserting he must be "totally just."

One work by this man ends with the image of water shooting up and falling back into a fountain as an analogy for the path from skepticism to common sense. In one work, this thinker argues that ideas cannot represent material objects, because they can only resemble other ideas. That is his "likeness principle." This thinker's belief that we cannot conceive of mind-independent objects, because the very act of conception requires a mind, is referred to as his "master argument."

In one work, this thinker showed how one of the title concepts produces a construct of individuality based on genetic, combinatory, cellular, and organic characteristics. This philosopher described the "Great Confinement" in which the mentally ill were no longer allowed to exist on the fringe of society, but were rather institutionalized. He defined each era's conception of the meaning of knowledge as its episteme.

This thinker rejected religion's moral and factual truth but praised its poetic capacity to produce piety and spirituality in the section "Reason in Religion." This thinker defined essence as embodiments of character through which humans perceive the world, contrasting it with matter, truth, and spirit. He argued that knowledge can be defined not by reasoned awareness but only by its application in action, meaning philosophy must begin in medias res.

Rorty's Achieving Our Country extols this philosopher as embodying the American spirit of Whitman's Democratic Vistas, identifying him as the "progressive Left" in contrast to the "critical Left" of Lyotard. This man argued that the first title entity is created only in response to "negative externalities" in a tract describing how corporate influence and vulgar pop culture had created an "eclipse," but not the "phantom" imagined by Walter Lippman. He described man as the "live creature" in his major text on aesthetics and challenged the stimulus-response model in an early Psychological Review article, but is best known for a work claiming that the formation of the mind resulted from an interplay between the individual and community.

This man attempted to unify the mental sciences with the physical sciences by proposing a mental chemistry. One text by this thinker argues that the title figures may have a "nervous temperament" and states that the only basis for the title "universal custom" is the perpetuation of the "law of the strongest." Another text by this thinker considers the example of Marcus Aurelius, who made the mistake of persecuting Christians. That text discusses whether truth may be justifiably persecuted and argues that actions should only be limited if they restrict the freedom of other individuals.

One work that discusses this human ability examines the life of mathematician Nicholas Saunderson to argue that it is one of two things that provide humanity with "reciprocal assistance." In addition to that work by Denis Diderot, a long-running philosophical debate surrounding it was finally resolved empirically by Pawan Sinha, who set up an experiment to examine it. In An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, Locke reproduces a letter written by Molyneux about whether this could be used to distinguish between a cube and a sphere if it was suddenly bestowed upon a human. Although this faculty's relation to distance was affirmed by Descartes, George Berkeley correctly believed that knowledge relating to this faculty was distinct from tactile knowledge.

One philosophy of this name was called "concrete metaphysics" and discussed in its author's book Riddles of the Sphinx. That movement of this name was inspired by the lectures of William James and started by FCS Schiller. A letter on this movement insists that the author's student mistranslated Dasein as "human reality." That letter by Heidegger to Jean Beaufret was itself a response to a lecture to the Club Maintenant, whose title ends with this word. That lecture asserts "existence precedes essence" and was written by Sartre to show that his philosophy is one of these movements.

The paper "On Leaving Out What It Is Like" proposes that there is no a priori connection between low-level descriptions and high-level descriptions of this concept, which is the reason for the explanatory gap that was elucidated by Joseph Levine. A different paper tackling this phenomenon discusses Type-A, Type-B, and Type-C materialism in relation to various arguments about it, such as the conceivability argument. The smallest individual units of subjective experience that characterize this state were formally introduced in a paper by Daniel Dennett entitled "Quining Qualia." The characteristics of the relation of this phenomenon to subjective experience is part of its namesake hard problem. David Chalmers wrote a work examining its relation to the mind, and the experiences that a human being has as a result of this state is the center of discussion in Nagel's What is It Like to be a Bat?

One text that tries to define this entity praises the example of a prince who repudiates the arrogant word "tolerant" and is an essay that argues that dogmas and formulas are tools that suppresses man's natural gifts. The author of Golgotha and Scheblimini represented a tradition that ran counter to this entity along with Vico and Herder according to a book by Isaiah Berlin. An analogy that mass culture is like a factory producing goods is central to a book that argued this tradition paved the way for the rise of Nazism; that book was written by Adorno and Horkheimer. "Dare to Know" and "Man's emergence from his self-imposed nonage" are two ways that Immanuel Kant defined this movement in a short work that asks what it is.

One book on this topic proposes that a meaning theory of justification is necessary to lay a "logical basis" for this discipline. That work by Michael Dummett was a response to the tendency of many philosophers to regard it as useless. A book titled after this topic introduces the idea that substances are compound forms, which is termed hylomorphism. The view that logical positivists regard this discipline as illogical, meaningless and semantically incorrect is examined in the first chapter of Language, Truth, and Logic, which also calls for its dismantling. One book titled for this discipline distinguishes between potentiality and actuality and introduces its author's unmoved mover argument.

An updated version of this work's ideas arranges metaphysical assumptions, values, exemplars and symbolic generations as portions of a "disciplinary matrix." This book argues that reading the Principia is challenging today due to a "gestalt flip." It suggests that the "normal" type of a certain discipline is merely problem solving and that textbooks are only produced in the aftermath of the resolution of so-called "anomalies." A controversial thesis in this book argues that since there is no "neutral observation language," the title entities are caused by incommensurable events. This book explains that the title events are caused by the adoption of new world views in light of new evidence, which is termed a paradigm shift.

One adherent of this philosophy wrote 211 mathematical proofs that focused on the material world called The Elements of Theology. This school's ideas were spread by a man who advanced the "sea-battle" argument in his treatise "On Interpretation." During the Renaissance, Marsilio Ficino wrote a six-volume treatise that reintroduced the ideas of this philosophy to the public. Ammonius Saccas taught one philosopher of this school, who wrote fifty-four treatises concerning topics such as "the One's" superiority over intellect.

One theorist who argued against the cognitive abilities of these entities posited that researchers often incorrectly made the ontological, epistemological, psychological and biological assumptions. After the success of the GPS program, Herbert Simon predicted that by 1967, all theories of modern psychology would take the form as one of these constructs. Hubert Dreyfus argued that attempting to give these entities the ability to think is akin to practicing alchemy, and Dreyfus also wrote a monograph on what they still "can't do." The inability for these agents to understand is highlighted by the example of a human who uses English rules to translate Chinese characters; that example was proposed by John Searle.

The origins of this idea "in modern society" is examined in a book by Roberto Unger. Jeremy Bentham's student John Austin developed a positive approach to this idea. A book that proposes the rule of recognition champions a different positivist approach to understanding this entity, and Frank Easterbrook is a prominent scholar in a field that uses economics to analyze it. It titles a book by HLA Hart and is equated with "integrity" in the works of a thinker who used a metaphor of Judge Hercules to evaluate whether it works within a society.

Another section of this treatise compares the plurality of its subject to the proliferation of cards and other activities, illustrating the author's thoughts on "family resemblances." It begins with a discussion of a quote by Augustine, to distinguish between a system of communication and this work's main subject. This work, which was written as a series of numbered aphorisms and has been translated into English by G.E.M. Anscombe, also includes a thought experiment in which people write a capital S in a diary after every time they feel a particular sensation.

One part of this treatise argues that everything profound hides behind a mask before discussing whether there are any "friends of truth." It proposes a distinction between a thinker that begets and a thinker that gives birth to argue that scientists are sometimes incapable of understanding human nature. This work defines nobility as distance between oneself and things, and it argues for using a "pathos of distance" as a tool of criticism. This work ends with a wedding song "From High Mountains" and is the first work of its author's to state "life  is the will to power." Its section "Peoples and Fatherlands" criticizes nationalism; other sections include "We Scholars" and "On the Prejudices of Philosophers."

This thinker's most famous work contains a discussion on the paradox surrounding how the good have power, while the bad are powerless. This author of De Topicis Differentiis argued that understanding God's foreknowledge is impossible in a treatise that includes a section wherein a woman reminds the author that he too, was once fortunate.

One thinker described this movement as a Verwindung rather than an overcoming and as a convalescence after the replacement of metaphysics by hermeneutics; that is Gianni Vattimo's concept of "weak thought." Habermas argued that this movement's critique of communicative reason is a performative contradiction, because it fails to overcome the "paradox of self-referentiality." One thinker argued that this replaced the mode of "parody" grounded in societal norms with the collage-like mode of "pastiche" without reference to norms, and refers to this as "The (*) Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism." A different thinker claimed its salient feature is a skepticism towards the totalizing nature of teleological interpretations of events, which he called "metanarratives."

John McDowell endorsed this thinker's view that raw experiences are endowed with rational content, allowing a spontaneous mind to still be receptive to empirical facts. A commentary on one of his works rejects most of it, but agrees that any self-conscious being aware of experiences must also be aware of objective realities, rebutting skepticism. In The Bounds of Sense, P.F. Strawson contends that (*) "transcendental deduction" is this man's most important contribution. Arthur Schopenhauer included an appendix of this thinker's errors in The World as Will and Representation, but also compared reading this man's writings to "a cataract operation on a blind person."

This work claims that the study of language was placed in a "quadrilateral" with corners of proposition, articulation, designation and derivation, in the chapter "Speaking." It argues that knowledge based on resemblance was replaced after the Renaissance by knowledge based on identity and difference. This book's preface describes its author's laughing response to a fictional Chinese encyclopedia that divides animals into absurd categories like "drawn with a...camelhair brush" in a passage by (*) Borges. It argues that fields such as natural history and general grammar are not ancestors of modern biology and linguistics, because all knowledge is limited to the episteme of its era.

This philosopher claimed one cannot move a single grain of sand from its place without changing the entire universe, arguing that any moment determines and is determined by every other moment. This thinker is taught that sensations are really mathematical points that our perception extends into surfaces, in an extended dialogue between himself and a Spirit that appears to him at midnight in a work divided into three books titled "Doubt", "Knowledge", and "Faith". He argued that the two possible foundations of philosophy were the pure (*) thinghood of Kant, which he labeled as a dogmatic form of realism, and the pure selfhood of his own philosophy, which he labeled as the true "transcendental idealism" apart from Kant's, and which is founded on the action of the self positing itself.

This thinker defined a scenario where a host treats a foreigner or other person as being in their proper place without asking for reciprocity as "absolute hospitality." One of this thinker's works is titled after an image that shows Plato standing behind a seated Socrates. Another asserts that the present is dependent on the past, which he calls "hauntology." He called writing that impacts the soul of the reader while maintaining the distinction between intention and conveyance "arche-writing." This author of The Post Card and Specters of Marx was inspired by Ferdinand de Saussure's idea of signs to explore the importance of dichotomies in literary works, thus developing an approach that would be used by Paul de Man. Among his better known works are Writing and Difference and Of Grammatology. For 10 points, name this French philosopher and literary critic, the founder of deconstruction.

Anthony Kenny argued against viewing one part of this argument as skepticism about memory in his criticism of Norman Malcolm's analysis of it. Another work compares this argument to Hume's solution to the problem of causation, claiming that it shows how ordinary practices do not require the justification we think, even if we concede the impossibility of truth-conditions. The claim that this is a "skeptical solution to the skeptic's paradox" appears in a book that opens with the example of the (*) "quus function" and argues that it is a corollary of a larger argument about rule-following. That book is by Saul Kripke. The reader is asked to imagine a person who writes "S" every time he feels a sensation in its original formulation in Philosophical Investigations.

One concept introduced in this book has been applied to political philosophy by Nikolas Kompridis, who has written about a "reflective" type of that concept. This book argues that the world should be characterized as a "totality of involvements." This book describes one of its aims as the destruction of traditional ontology, in order to replace ontical inquiry with fundamental ontology.

According to a paper by Roderick Chisholm, methodism, particularism and this position are the three possible responses to the problem of the criterion. An early proponent of this position was Agrippa, who sometimes gives his name to an argument which points out that that it is impossible to avoid invoking the circular argument, the regressive argument, or the axiomatic argument. This philosophical position is opposed by a form of externalism known as reliabilism. The writings of Sextus Empiricus are the main source for information about the Pyrrhonian variety of this school of thought.

John Haldane is one of the leaders of an "analytical" school of thought dedicated to this thinker, the study of whose work was espoused by Leo XIII's bull Aeterni Patris. One of his works may have been written at the behest of Raymond of Peafort and is split into a discussion of human truths and divine truths.

The final chapter of this work, "Applications," attempts to clarify the meaning of the two maxims which, according to the author, form its entire doctrine. It ends by giving three reasons for resisting government interference, including the desire not to add unnecessarily to government power.

In the Platonic dialogue named after a disciple of this man, the title character renounces speech in favor of finger wagging because he's convinced words aren't reliable; that disciple was Cratylus. This Greek philosopher was a strong proponent of dialectical monism, partially due to his belief that up and down were the same. This man was characterized by some of his contemporaries as "the weeping philosopher." This philosopher considered fire to be the most fundamental element.

This book defines a descriptive language which, if questioned, leaves its user with no non-circular recourse, which it calls a "final vocabulary," and claims that in writing "Envois," Derrida did for the history of philosophy what Proust did for himself. Its final section is dedicated to discussions of books about cruelty and includes a chapter about Nabokov titled "The Barber of Kasbeam."

Quine wrote a 1956 paper in which he examined the case of a citizen named Ralph and a mayor named Bernard J. Ortcutt as a way of explaining how quantification works over contexts relevant to these concepts; that paper is widely held to have originated the de re/de dicto distinction between two types of this concept. Saul Kripke postulated the existence of a bilingual Frenchman named Pierre who utters the sentences "Londres est jolie" and "London is not pretty," but does not know that Londres is London in order to illustrate a "puzzle" concerning this concept.

John Earman has constructed a Bayesian characterization of the most famous argument about these concepts, holding that the best-known work about them is an "abject failure." In a 1968 paper partially devoted to the refutation of an argument by Anthony Flew, Roger Swinburne argued that there could exist sufficiently strong historical evidence for these phenomena. The most famous argument against these phenomena establishes that "uniform experience" is a "direct and full proof" against them," which "cannot be destroyed... but by an opposite proof which is superior," and concludes that "mere reason" or personal testimony is insufficient to ever convince one of the truth of Christianity.

The first published refutation of it was presented in the text In Defense of the Fool and discusses the absurdity of a lost island. Immanuel Kant pointed out its flaw in assuming perfection is predicated by existence. Statements that express beliefs, or modalities, were used by Plantinga to update this idea.

The nineteenth book of this work asserts that pacifism in the face of a conflict solvable only by violence is not moral in a section that coined the term "just war". This work was written partly in response to a campaign of destruction carried out by the Visigoths, which many blamed on the abandonment of Roman religion.

This thinker argued against the Cartesian account of substances by noting that matter is divisible, and wrote that since substances cannot interact, God has established mind and body in a "pre-established harmony." In his argument that a substance expresses the whole universe, this philosopher developed the idea of "petits perceptions," found in a book in which he represented himself as Theophilius and John Locke as Philalethe.

An architectural term from renaissance archways was borrowed to describe a consequence of this theory by Richard Lewontin, whose "spandrels" were attacked in the aforementioned work by Jerry Fodor. A dubious argument found in Warrant and Proper Function uses some dude named Paul's encounter with a tiger to claim that this theory implies humans cannot evaluate truth; Alvin Plantinga thus declared it an argument against Naturalism.

This man ironically said that even "the most stupid and ignorant" men see that beasts reason just like themselves in section 16 of Part 3 of one work. It was said to follow from his beliefs that night causes day and vice versa by his critic Thomas Reid. He argued that due to our limited mental capacity, space and time must be finitely divisible. One of his works ends with a fictional Epicurus speech and often uses the image of colliding billiard balls; that work describes "custom or habit" as the reason people perceive causation. He distinguished ideas from impressions, insisted no one can obtain an "ought" from an "is", and declared reason to be "the slave of the passions".

Near the end of this religious thinker's life, he sought to interpret Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy in his The Harmony of the Law. In his Psalmic commentaries, he suggested that David knew Christ through the "Spirit of prophecy" when the latter cried out, "My god, my god, why have you forsaken me?" This man's major work opens with the argument that the knowledge of God and of ourselves is mutually connected; it then refutes arguments in favor of free will, claims that the benefits of Christ are made available "by the secret operations of the spirit," and that salvation for the elect is already predetermined.

Its fourth chapter notes "that questions of ultimate ends do not admit of proof," but argues that what matters in evaluating whether people desire something is whether they actually do desire it. This work's "General Remarks" repudiate the idea of an innate moral sense. Its second chapter defends Epicureans against those who equate human pleasure with the pleasure of swine, and refutes those who, with Carlyle, ask "what right hast thou to be happy?"

In one work, this thinker explored Descartes' "project of pure enquiry" and its failure to provide an "absolute conception" of reality, and in another work, imagined that "the day cannot be too far off... in which we shall hear no more" of a certain philosophical doctrine. This thinker began with a "sub-Humean" model of motivation in a paper that concluded that only "internal reasons" rather than "external reasons" exist. This philosopher denied the possibility of doing moral philosophy from what he called an "Archimedean point," outside of all knowledge, and called morality, "the peculiar institution" that we "would be better off without," in his 1985 work Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy. In a notable paper, answered by a paper of the same title by Thomas Nagel, this philosopher used the story of Gauguin to argue that moral justifications are not independent of fortune.

The fifth chapter of this work contrasts "single-track" and "multi-tracked" concepts to explain its author's theory of dispositions. This work introduces one important concept by positing a visitor to Oxford who sees the buildings but asks "where is the university?"  This work demonstrates an infinite regress to debunk the "intellectualist legend" that intelligent action is always preceded by theorizing, and it later suggests a solution to that problem in the distinction between "knowing how" and "knowing that."  This work introduces the concept of a "category mistake" to argue that it's a fallacy to consider the mind an entity in the same sense as the body, and also argues against the concept of a "ghost in the machine" in an attack on Cartesian dualism.

Another section of this work blames the "seduction of grammar" for the belief in both the ego and a transcendent moral soul. The preface to this work claims that the greatest error was the creation of the "pure spirit" and likens the current tension in Europe to a bow with which "we can now shoot for the most distant goals" beyond the childishness of current dogmatism. Drawing in its author's earlier essays, it claims that philosophers' "will to truth" fails to acknowledge its inherent self-interestedness and pushes for a return to a nobler morality that doesn't draw from the meek, apologetic ethics of Judaism.

Its defines the good as that with which an individual lacks nothing, and says that independence, power, renown, reverence, and delight are only attained as joint attributes of happiness in God. The title figure bears a staircase design on a robe from which arrogant men tear off pieces, and acts as the nurse of the soul.

Using this rule allows one to add additional terms to the left-hand sides of hypotheses in the deduction theorem; in that case, the form of this principle used is known as Pierce's law. The so-called consequentia mirabilis relies only on this result. This is the first derived statement in the Principia Mathematica, which proves it by taking the disjunction of the modus ponens and modus tollens to yield "p implies q equals not p or q," then considering what happens if q is allowed to be p. Polyvalent logics are ones lacking this rule, and N-valued logics have versions of this rule applying to N minus one disjunctions of mutual exclusions. Sometimes confused with the principle of bivalence, this law was first stated in Aristotle's On Interpretation as the principle of non-contradiction.

In a 1976, Michael Stocker condemned competing approaches to this theory as "schizophrenic" for failing to examine "motives and motivational structures." An agent-based variant of this theory that takes inspiration from Frances Hutchenson and James Martineau, among others, was developed by Michael Slote. A book advocating this theory begins by imagining a world in which science has been destroyed and subsequently revived, although it is practiced without true understanding, and argues that this is the situation of one particular branch of philosophy. The development of this theory was largely inspired by G. E. M. Anscombe's paper "Modern Moral Philosophy," and it looks back to concepts such as arete, phronesis, and eudaemonia.

This work ends with a chapter entitled "Solutions of Outstanding Philosophical Disputes", which is mildly ironic, as it sparked a long-running philosophical debate that saw its author publish Foundations of Empirical Knowledge and defend his sense-data theory against the attacks found in Sense and Sensibilia by John Austen. This work establishes "strong" and "weak" forms of its central practice, which evaluates all non-tautologies using a "criterion of meaning."

In a 1978 article, Daniel Dennett concluded that our concept of this phenomenon was incoherent and argued against the possibility of implementing this phenomenon as a computer program. In Naming and Necessity, Saul Kripke argued that this phenomenon was not "picked out by one of its accidental properties," but rather "by its immediate phenomenological quality," and that it was absurd to suggest that it could exist without being a mental state. An article by David Lewis drew on a theory by David Armstrong to characterize this phenomenon as "a state that occupies a certain causal role;" that paper called it a "non-rigid" concept and argued that "a credible theory of mind needs to make a place for both"  the "mad" and the "Martian" varieties of this phenomenon.

It argues that a single moment of awareness cannotcontain either knowledge or belief, because any concept experienced in that moment must refer to anessence outside of the moment. Thus, the ultimate foundation of knowledge is not metaphysicallyprovable, but is instead "radically incapable of proof" and arises from environmental happenstance.That is the explication of this book's noted opening sentence, (*) "a philosopher is compelled to followthe maxim of epic poets and to plunge in medias res."

Peter Smith and Tony Brueckner's namesake articles about this concept criticized the "disquotation" used to refute its possibility by the writer who compared it to a Martian seeing a painting that accidentally resembles a tree. By use of the "causal constraint" which says that a term can only refer to an object if there is an actual connection between the term and the object, a philosopher put forth the "semantic externalism" argument against the possibility of this scenario in 1981's Reason, Truth, and History. Ted Warfield's refutation of this idea relies on another thought experiment put forth by its creator, the Twin Earth argument. For 10 points, name this scenario analyzed by Hilary Putnam, which involves an evil genius creating false experiences by electrical stimulation of a disembodied cortex.

In a response to his critics, this man accused Isaac Newton of failing to properly eliminate the "rectangle of the moments" and discusses the similarities between believing in God and believing in fluxions. Another of his works explores the difference between pleasure and heat to support the "master argument." He points out that we do not see the same moon that we can travel to, but rather see a small disk which is quite unlike the actual moon, in his attempt to explain how distance is perceived in the Essay Toward a New Theory of Vision.

In his essay "On the Basis of Our Belief in a Divine Governance of the World," he argued that God has no existence apart from the morality of the world, which caused him to be accused of atheism. He responded to those accusations in The Vocation of Man, and gave a series of Addresses to the German Nation in 1808 before returning to the University of Jena.

It is divided into four sections, two explaining the "naturalistic" and "anti-naturalistic" versions of the title concept, which is blamed on the early understanding of eclipses lending validity to the "dream of prophecy." Also taking aim at sociological "holism," it is dedicated to victims of "the fascist and communist belief in Inexorable Laws ofDestiny" and elaborates on the need for a critical spirit previously advocated in The Open Society and Its Enemies.

In one book, this writer attempted to provide solutions to the problems left open by both natural-right and classical social contract theories by introducing the idea of an "overlapping consensus." His last book, The Law of Peoples, applied his methods to the problem of inter-state relations, again grounding these relations on a minimal conception of relational fairness.

One section of this work says that even though poets might not lead perfectly religious lives, they have the liberty of discussing religious matters. The final section, Part IIB, states that failing to take action to increase faith is a sin, while an earlier section says that a man wanting to be Caesar is an example of the key cause of the titular phenomenon. Yet another section names "defiance" and "weak" types of the key cause, and the author quotes Macbeth to illustrate the paradox of winning over sin. Other sections conclude that Christianity is based on the absurd principle of personal faith but that true Christians are the only ones not affected by a key cause of the titular malady, which is despair.

This work's15th section criticizes Mill and Tocqueville for "devalu[ing] the consequences" of a process they favored for the sake of principle,and it traces the beginnings of the title event partly to the Tory opposition in the 1720s. This work is critical of moderndemocracies and welfare states for allowing their citizenry to develop "a general attitude of demand," which subsumes genuinepolitical interests under "administrative acts," thereby leading to a degeneration of the title concept. Tracing the originsof the title concept to modern understanding of the concept of a "private" citizen, this work analyzes the rise and fall of "coffeehouses" and "salons" as the central loci of the title concept, which the author fears has been undermined by a transitionfrom "culture-debating" to "culture-consuming."

This work claims that it is impossible to derive that two lines cannot contain space from the definitions of a straight line and the number two. Its author believes that one can never know the empirical ego, since the mind can only experience itself through filtered perception, the transcendental ego.

In one of his most quoted maxims, this man claimed that "There is no one who loves pain itself simply because it is pain." In a dialogue by this author, a soldier on a military campaign has a celestial out-of-body experience in which he observes the smallness of Earth compared to the stars. This thinker sublimated his grief after the death of his daughter into the tract (*) Consolatio, and unwittingly inspired St. Augustine to take up philosophy with his Hortensius, both of which are now lost. The "Dream of Scipio" is the last book of this author's adaptation of Plato's Republic.

The application of Wittgenstein's ideas to this concept is the subject of a 1972 book by Hannah Pitkin, and in a work on The Philosophy of Moral Development, Lawrence Kohlberg examined "moral stages and the idea of" this concept. In his Treatise of Human Nature, Hume claimed that this concept was the "support of society," and asked whether it was a natural or an artificial virtue. John Tomasi is the author of a book that examines "Liberalism beyond" this concept, and in another work, a man named Thrasymachus claims that it is nothing but the interests of the stronger.

An early work of his revives Kantian notions of ethics in arguing for a rational type of the titular behavior, and the title of another of his books, which talks about "dual aspect theory" and refers to a "strain of idealism" in contemporary philosophy, refers to the attempt to find a truly objective conception of reality.  His most notable work cites Davidson's anomalous monism, and chooses its central figure due to having a "sensory apparatus" strikingly different than man so as to illustrate the centrality of the "subjective character of experience" to the mind-body problem.

One prominent school of Buddhist philosophy describes this concept as the way in which clarity is achieved. One philosopher divided this into subjective, objective, and absolute, which can include the ideology of a state. John Smart and Ullin Place developed the type-identity of this concept. That theory was criticized by Putnam and Fodor, who developed the functionalist theory of this. Experiences that are unique to this concept independently from signals are known as qualia, which are not experienced by zombies. Nicolas Malebranche's occasionalism deals with the way phenomena are placed in this concept by God, and the evil demon hypothesis, due to Descartes, posits a situation in which only this exists.

He was critical of Bultmann's hermeneutical method of scriptural de-mythologization arguing that it unfairly introduced a "false rationalism" in religion, instead arguing for a "philosophical faith," in such works as Philosophical Faith in Face of Christian Revelation. He outlines a typology of mental attitudes based on a fundamental division which he called the Subjekt-Objeckt-Spaltung, in his work The Psychology of World Views. One work offers that for the Holocaust that while there exists collective liability there ought not to exist collective guilt in The Question of German Guilt.

One part of this work states that the fact that the word "bachelor" has less than ten letters proves that the word "bachelor" cannot always be replaced with "unmarried man." Later, it asks whether a statement "taken in isolation from its fellows, can admit of confirmation or infirmation at all." Previously, this work expresses an inability to evaluate the statement "everything green is extended"  and says that "a precise artificial languge with explicit semantical rules" would not solve the problem.  The author of this paper noted that many of its ideas were first expressed by Morton White in an essay about "an untenable dualism" from a book about John Dewey. Claiming that "abandoning" the title entities will lead to "a blurring of the supposed boundary between speculative metaphysics and natural science" as well as more pragmatism, this essay begins by reviewing a distinction made by Kant.

This concept is said to be immanent and mythical, but not transcendental in Thomas Flanagan's treatment of it. In The Banquet, Dante uses this concept to explain why a man at Falterona found a collection of silver. This concept is held to be the "arbiter of one half our actions" according to an author who suggested that virtu, or man's force, can oppose, but not ultimately conquer this concept. In another work, songs titled "Nero's Infamy" and "Glory May Not Last" precede discussions in which the title figure analogizes this idea to an inconstant game. Niccolo Machiavelli suggested that it needs to be "beaten and coerced" like a woman in the twenty-fifth chapter of The Prince.

In one lecture, this man described an explorer's offer to go to the North Pole as a "momentous option," rather than a trivial option, and the need to cross an icy ledge on an isolated trail as a "forced" option. In two writings, he used the example of a person chased by a bear in the forest, who first feels a racing heartbeat and then feels (*) fear, in his account of emotion. This man contrasted the "healthy-minded temperament" among some zealots with the "sick soul" of others. He claimed that truth is made when a belief has "cash value" in the daily life of its believer, and surveyed many mystics and credos in Varieties of Religious Experience.

An early paper by this man argued that the structure of metaphysics used to have a "center," such as God or Man, but doesn't anymore. This man criticized the desire for a "transcendental signified" to which all signs eventually point. He lost popularity after publicly excusing the Nazi ties of his Belgian colleague Paul de Man. Gayatri Spivak translated a large book by this man, which shows Thoth on the cover and opens by declaring "There is nothing outside the (*) text."

This philosopher wrote of a vision in which a garment had a "pi" embroidered at its bottom edge and "theta" at the top, with a staircase connecting the two. A Christian legend, which held that this man married the hym- nist Helpes, was disputed by Edward Gibbon, who also challenged the authenticity of this man's autobiog- raphy, De Disciplina Scolarium. This man outlines a proof of God based on the standard of perfect happiness in a book that begins with the muses being interrupted by the title allegorical lady. He died in the midst of a pro- ject to translate all of Plato and Aristotle into Latin, shortly before his patron Symmachus was also executed.

The eighth part of this book refutes the Epicurean Hypothesis by suggesting that the world would not have been dissolved if African and Arabian camels did not exist. Another section of this work argues that on a planet full of spiders, the Brahmin belief that the world was created by an infinite spider would be very reasonable. Its last section cites Galen's description of the six hundred muscles and the 284 bones in the human body to illustrate a certain argument. This book, which incorporates the a priori arguments of Samuel Clarke, (*) uses George Cheyne's argument to describe the infinite nature of the world. This 1776 work, which was inspired by Cicero's The Nature of the Gods, compares the universe to a machine during a discussion of the so-called "argument from design."

In a commentary on a work named after this philosopher, Gilbert Ryle claimed that the aim of that work was to demonstrate that "when we treat a formal concept as if it were a non-formal concept... we are committing a breach of 'logical syntax.'" G.E.M. Anscombe argued that a principle developed by this philosopher can be reformulated as "whatever can be said at all can be said clearly," in a work whose title references philosophy "From" this thinker "to Wittgenstein." Jonathan Barnes called the work of Melissus of Samos, Concerning Nature or What Is, "no more than a cheap edition of" this thinker's work, which is preserved a 150-line hexameter poem (*) translated by Simplicius. That poem takes the form of a dialogue between the philosopher and the goddess who exhorts him to choose the "way of truth" over the "way of opinion." The dialogue named for this philosopher consists of two parts, the former of which concenrs the necessity of forms, and the latter of which discusses the consequences of the hypotheses "the one is," and "the one is not." That dialogue named for this thinker also contains the notable infinite regress article known as the "Third Man."

A late work of social science by this man contains a "Didactic" section on "cognizing the interior as well as the exterior of the human being" and a "Characteristic" section on cognizing the human interior from the exterior. For this man, the "unity of all places on the face of the Earth as a spherical surface" was one justification for property rights and hospitality. This man included mathematical, commercial, moral, and theological branches in his sixfold division of the field of geography. This man gave more lectures on geography than any other subject, claiming that it was a "propadeuctic" (*) to prepare people for ethics. While at the Albertina University on Kneiphof, an island now named for him, this man posited a program for the social sciences in Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View. He presaged democratic peace theory by positing that all nations should be republics in an essay written like a mock treaty.

"Principle F" is part of a non-conventionalist theory of these acts known as the "expectation view," proposed in the early 1990s by Tim Scanlon. A so-called "Complicated Way" of defining this sort of act involves nine separate conditions which must hold, of which the first reads: "Normal input and output conditions obtain". Along with forgiveness, this type of action is a remedy for the twofold "darkness of human affairs" according to Hannah Arendt's The Human Condition. Hume's Treatise of Human Nature claims that the purported force of this sort of act is as magical as "transubstantiation, or holy orders." The claim that early man was too forgetful to engage in this activity is made in the Second Essay of Friedrich Nietzsche's On the Genealogy of Morals, (*) which opens by explaining how "to breed an animal that is entitled to" do this sort of act. To determine the structure of illocutionary acts in general, John Searle analyzed the "sincere" and "insincere" type of these in his 1969 book Speech Acts, noting that insincere ones still make the speaker S "responsible for intending to do" a spoken-about action A.

This philosophic concept is held to be a fundamental category in the radical, "practicalist" account of Stephen Hetherington. A paper that heavily draws on the linguistic work of Lauri Karttunen argues that this concept is a practical mode of presentation applied to propositions called "ways". That 2001 paper titled for this concept is by Jason Stanley and Timothy Williamson. Another analysis of this concept argues that a clown who trips on purpose exhibits no extra mental process when contrasted with a clumsy man. In their separate replies to Frank Jackson, Laurence Nemirow and David Lewis each argue that this is what Mary (*) acquires when she leaves her room. This concept is argued to consist of multi-track dispositions in a work which uses an infinite regress to show that intelligent action can't always be preceded by the consideration of a proposition. The refutation of that "intellectualist legend" is used to argue that this first title concept is distinct from the second title concept in chapter 2 of Gilbert Ryle's Concept of Mind.

The third of a six part work by W. K. C. Gurthrie concerns this figure and draws on both a 1818 paper by Schleiermacher and the 20th century work on this figure by Olof Gigon. In one episode, this figure compares himself to a midwife who is barren himself but may help others have children. This figure is referred to as the "second spectator" in a book in which he replaces Apollo and becomes the opposing force to Dionysus. In that book, The Birth of Tragedy, Nietzsche says that this figure had a "monstrous lack of any capacity for mysticism" because of his divine sign, (*) which warns him not to do certain things. Epictetus' Discourses has multiple references to this man's quote that "Anytus and Meletus may kill me, but they cannot hurt me." Cicero remarked that this thinker "brought philosophy down from heaven" and this man's discussions often lead to aporia, or impasse, with his interlocutors who include Charmides and Gorgias. For ten points, name this man who was the wisest man in Athens because he knew that he knew nothing.

In the Platonic dialogue on this topic, Socrates asks whether whether a pig has this characteristic. That dialogue on this topic ends in aporia after Socrates convinces another character that the definition he has provided of this characteristic is in fact a definition of all virtue. That dialogue on this topic is also the only one in which Nicias appears, and in that dialogue, Nicias defines this trait as "knowledge of the grounds of hope and fear", whereas the title character of the dialogue describes it as "a sort of endurance of the soul". This trait is the first virtue discussed at length in the Nichomachean Ethics, (*) in which Aristotle states that "death is the most terrible of all things, for it is the end" and differentiates this virtue from ignorance, experience, sanguinity and passion. Aristotle also gives Hector as an example of this virtue and argues that the Celts have an excess of it. The Platonic dialogue on this subject begins when two friends ask the title character whether they should have their sons instructed in "the art of fighting in armour"; that title character is the conservative Athenian general Laches. For 10 points, name this virtue which Aristotle described as a mean between rashness and cowardice.

This philosopher argued that just because moral dilemmas exist does not mean that there also exists some inconsistency in a set of moral principles in a paper titled "Moral Dilemmas and Consistency." In one paper, this philosopher proposed the use of substitutional semantics to accomplish the paper's title goal, "Dispensing with Possibilia." A formula developed by this thinker allows for the interchange of quantifiers and modal operators, resulting in statements like "if it is possible that there exists an object satisfying P, then there exists an object that possibly satisfies P." In the article titled "Modality and Intensional Languages," (*) this philosopher proposed that names have no meanings, but are simply "tags." This philosopher's early work included a paper titled "A Functional Calculus of First Order Based on Strict Implication," which began her project of quantifying modal logic.

This text posits that the "nutritive" variety of the title concept is "the most primitive and widely distributed," and Part 2 of its first book contains a listing of various theories of the title concept developed by the author's predecessors. The third book of this text posits "possible" and "agent" intellects, (*) and many of the topics addressed in this work are also covered in the same author's Parva Naturalia.. This text asserts that the body is the material of a living creature, but the title entity is its form, an example of its author's framework of hylomorphism.

A 1963 paper about these concepts by Anthony Kenney was one of the first to argue that these concepts possessed intentionality. In a book titled after "The Structure of" these concepts, Robert Gordon argued that most of these are factive propositional attitudes. These concepts are at the core of the non-propositional appraisal theory developed by Jese Prinz. Paul Griffiths classified six of these concepts as basic evolutionary homologues in a work whose title claims to say "What" these concepts "Really Are." In an essay whose title asks "What is" one of these concepts, William James (*) drew on Darwin's work on these concepts to argue that they represented the awareness of a "bodily sounding board." Antonio Damaso's book Descartes' Error develops the "somatic marker" hypothesis of these concepts and argues against a theory of them that Descartes developed in a 1649 work.

Another influential essay by this philosopher concerned two figures which this thinker called "the two most general forms of intellectual culture," one of whom is the "guardian of the absolute" while the other "doubts all that appears self-evident." In addition to "What is Socialism?" and "The Priest and the Jester," this philosopher collected a group of essays he called "semi-philosophical sermons" in a book titled Modernity on Endless Trial. (*) A book by this thinker contains a chapter on Georgy Lukacs, calling him "reason in the service of dogma." This thinker's most important work consists of three volumes titled "Founders," "The Golden Age," and "Breakdown," the latter of which examines varying approach to its title subject, such as Marcuse's, which this author called "the totalitarian utopia of the left."

The inability to distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate explicability arguments has led Michael Della Rocca to embrace this philosophical idea.  Peter van Inwagen and Jonathan Bennett considered the conjunction of all contingent true statements in a paper that argues that this statement implies necessitarianism. Anaximander is often credited with first invoking this idea to explain why the Earth is stationary. Kant identifies this idea with the causal principle in the Second Analogy of Experience in the Critique of Pure Reason, and earlier attacked Christian Wolff's (*) argument that this statement is self-evident in the New Elucidation. Though it notably does not appear explicitly in the axioms of Ethics, Spinoza uses this principle to deduce the necessary existence of God and to reduce concepts like existence and causation to intelligibility. The Principle of Contradiction and this idea ground the philosophy of Leibniz, who coined this idea's name. Another philosopher distinguished forms of this principle grounded in becoming, knowing, being, and acting.

This philosopher built on the ideas of P.F. Strawson in a work that distinguishes between "attribution" as the logical joining of predicates to individuals and "ascription" which imputes agency to the individual's action. He suggested that Nietzsche was responsible for making "I think, therefore I am" unviable as a basis for philosophical knowledge, a state that he called the "shattered cogito", and he grouped Nietzsche with Freud and Marx as the three progenitors of what he called the "hermeneutics of suspicion." (*) One work by him discusses "sameness" and "selfhood" as the two components of "identity". In one work, he identified the calendar, the succession of generations, and the archive as the three conditions of "historical time", a concept opposed to "human time".

Participants were asked to retell the Canadian Indian "War of the Ghosts" story in a study by Frederic Bartlett that suggested that this process is reconstructive rather than reproductive. In the Roman Empire, lawyers owned slaves called graeculi whose sole job was to employ this process. Henri Bergson divided this into a "pure" form (*) that preserves the spiritual essence of an occurrence and a "habit" form that reproduces an idea as a biological mechanism.

An influential 1973 paper by David Lewis named after this phenomenon introduced the concept of "comparative similarity" (*) in offering a counterfactual development of this idea. In The Critique of Pure Reason, this phenomenon is, along with "inherence and subsistence" and "community," one of the three "Categories of Relation;" earlier, in the preface to his Prolegomena, Kant wrote that a notable attack on this principle interrupted his "dogmatic slumber."

Two objections raised alongside the presentation of this theory were the idea of a grandmother who doesn't know her grandson is sick and someone seeing an event through glancing; those objections are solved by adding a "method" condition. A key objection to this theory is that is lacks closure, leading to the "abominable conjunction" of being able to affirm, for example, that you have two hands but not that you're a (*) brain in a vat. This theory gives the "correct" response to the overdetermined-death problem and the Gettier problem, and it has two conditions: first, if a proposition were true, that a person S would believe it, and second, that if a proposition weren't true, that S wouldn't believe it.

An o t-quoted passage claims that each of these things is "an original existence... and contains not any representative quality, which renders it a copy of any other existence," meaning that it is sensible to prefer "the destruction of the whole world to the scratching of [one's]  nger." Chapter 6 of Leviathan presents a list of these concepts and describes them as "the interior beginnings of voluntary motions." These things are indirect if they arise from a "double relation of impressions and ideas," and direct if they are directly caused by pain or pleasure. These things can be "calm" or "violent," and are classi ed as impressions caused by re lection. The second book of A Treatise of Human Nature is titled "of" these phenomena, and argues that since these things are responsible for all motivations, "reason is, and ought only to be the slave of" these things.

This thinker characterized people who reached an existential crisis as "sick souls" with the possibility of being born again. This man argued that consciousness is more fluid than a chain of ideas as previously described, thus coining the phrase "stream of consciousness". He argued that the truth of a fact depends on the usefulness of its consequences, and thus there is no reason to debate about a man chasing a squirrel around a tree.

Immanuel Kant argued that this position is necessary to guarantee that virtue necessarily leads to happiness, given enough time to attain that highest good. Ren Descartes used this position to justify the truth of clear and distinct ideas. The teleological argument for this position is sometimes described with the analogy of a watchmaker. Thomas Aquinas included the first mover and the first cause as two of his "five ways" of justifying this belief, rejecting Anselm of Canterbury's ontological argument for this belief.

This philosopher analyzed possible responses of a commoner to his love for a princess to illustrate a concept in one work. In that work, he argued that Agamemnon's dilemma was entirely ethical but Abraham had to choose between ethics and religion in this man's analysis of the sacrifice of their respective children. This writer believed that Abraham's willingness to sacrifice Isaac demonstrated that he was one of two people to move beyond infinite resignation to become a knight of faith, and he described that event as an example of a teleological suspension of the ethical.

This philosopher exclaimed "Too late have I loved thee!" twice in an o t-excerpted passage from a meditation on memory paradoxes. Long before McTaggart, this philosopher argued that, because long metric feet can only be measured relative to short feet in the past, time has no existence except as "distension" of memory. He anticipated Descartes by asserting "If I am deceived, I am" regarding existence, and developed the "argument from analogy" to rebut solipsism. In Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations, this philosopher's account of learning words "repeatedly used in their proper places" illustrates the "picture theory" Wittgenstein rejects.

This author of "New Work For a Theory of Universals" and "Scorekeeping in a Language Game" characterized reality as "a vast mosaic of local matters of particular fact." Applying the "Ramsification" procedure, this philosopher defended mind-body identity, a special case of his Humean supervenience (HYOO-mee-an "super"-VEEN-ee-ents).

An opponent of this theory argued that the answer to the question "What is the aim of chess?" may be either "checkmate" or "fame." Arthur Fine provided a middle-ground alternative to this position called "NOA" ("noah"), which Alan Musgrave analyzed in a paper titled "NOA's Ark - Fine for" this position. This position was critiqued in the "dappled world" theory of Nancy Cartwright, who espoused the "entity" version of it preferred by Ian Hacking and the Stanford School. An alien community that observes a "thermally incandescent river of molecules" instead of "3re" was used to defend this position by Paul Churchland, who objected to Bas van Fraasen's alternative theory to it. Hilary Putnam's "no miracles" argument for this position is undermined by Larry Laudan's "pessimistic induction" against it.

This book argues that the automation of labor turns "apparatuses we once handled freely" into "shells...as...belong to the body of the turtle." It dates the beginning of "world alienation" to the research of Galileo, because his discovery of universal scienti c laws caused people to view themselves from Ka ka's "Archimedean point." This book critiques Karl Marx by arguing that his "communistic  ction" is inherently present in liberal democracy, because the expropriation of the religious establishment already channeled the "life process" from the private to the public. It delineates man as sovereign homo faber from man as unfree animal laborans, but argues that both possess the quality of instrumentality, and thus fall short of the conception of man as zoon politikon (ZOH-oh po-LIT-ik-on) in ancient Athens. This text identi es work, labor, and action as the key forms of activity, with political action being the highest because of its freedom.

This man defends conceptual relativity, the idea that existence depends on convention, in a set of four lectures advocating "pragmatic pluralism." This author of Ethics Without Ontology discussed an ant moving along in the sand accidentally drawing a picture of Winston Churchill, to put forth a theory of "causal connection" to formulate an argument that refutes metaphysical realism. In his book Reason, Truth and History, this philosopher refuted a skeptical argument by stating that the statement "there is a tree" would be incoherent if a tree were actually a simulated tree produced by a computer program.

Proclus's commentary on Euclid states that one member of this school of philosophy believed that all mathematical theorems are Platonic Forms since they include "unlimited figures" within "defined loci." Joannes Stobaeus's Eclogae records that the founder of this school stated that lekta or "sayables" were not "somethings or qualified things, but were rather quasi-somethings and quasi-qualified things." According to this school's cosmology, at the end of a "Great year" an ekpyrosis, or great conflagration, would destroy the universe, and fill it with pneuma, a vital organizing substance.

In the 1980s, Willem Nijenhuis argued that Hadrian Saravia was the only Elizabethan-era philosopher to articulate this doctrine. Scholarly interest in this doctrine was revived in the 19th century with John Figgis's intellectual history of it, a book that grew out of a debate he had with John Allen, who argued it was misconstrued with the right of discretion. Ernst Kantorowicz argued that this right was derived from the second of a certain person's "two bodies" in a 1957 book which makes reference to Richard Hooker, who rejected this doctrine in Book 8, Chapter 3 of his magnum opus.

In a series of Letters addressed to John Norris, Mary Astell argued against this philosophy stating that there is no such thing as a "sensible congruity." A form of this philosophy advocated by Arnold Geulincx in his text Metaphysica vera uses the example of two clocks which stay synchronized due to the regularity of their maker's actions. In England, this idea was promoted by Thomas Taylor in his book Two Covenants of God with Mankind. Gottfried Leibniz rejected this stance and instead relied on "pre-established harmony," though Antoine Arnauld argued it isindistinguishable from this view.

This man, who was discussed as a "moral philosopher" in that book by Gregory Vlastos, was described as a "magnificent pause in the course of history" in a master's thesis submitted in 1841 that argued against Hegel's view that this man was merely a "founder of morality." That thesis argues that this philosopher facilitated the birth of subjectivity and makes "continual reference" to this man.

In 1862, Adolf Trendelenberg argued that a certain philosopher had not shown these concepts to be non-objective, an objection sometimes called the "neglected alternative." The "wormview," in contrast to the "stage view," uses these concepts to uniquely identify physical objects. Contra the philosopher Samuel Clarke, a relativist argument for these concepts was advocating using both the Principle of Sufficient Reason and the Identity of Discernibles in a correspondence by Leibniz. In the "Transcendental Aesthetic" section of Critique of PureReason, Immanuel Kant suggests that these two concepts are inherently subjective.

The second section of this work addresses the difficulty of passing judgment on someone who has turned from evil to good by noting that punishments for former evil are not appropriate to the now-good individual, as he is "morally another person." This work argues against the vicarious atonement theory, holding instead that the sacrifice of Jesus was an exemplary one, and its first section is dedicated to an analysis of radical evil. The preface to this work argues that although morality, in itself, has no need of the title concept, it nevertheless "leads ineluctably to," that title concept, extending to the idea of a "powerful moral Lawgiver, outside of mankind."

Bas van Fraassen's version of anti-realism about this domain is called "constructive empiricism." Another model of this domain involves a negative heuristic that forbids changing the "hard core" and a positive heuristic that revises the "protective belt." The impossibility of dealing with an idea in this domain in isolation leads to underdetermination in a problem first put forth by Pierre Duhem. Epistemological anarchism, the rejection of (*) rules for this activity, was put forth by Paul Feyerabend in opposition to Imre Lakatos.

This philosopher was born in Marburg, Germany in 1900, beginning his studies in Breslau and moving later to Marburg along with Neo-Kantians such as Paul Natorp before presenting his dissertation in 1922. Following the defense of his dissertation, he moved to Freiburg and studied alongside Martin Heidegger, from whom he would gain in interest in Philosophical Hermeneutics, the basis of his best known work. In that work, he argued that people's interpretation of texts was necessarily bound by both their time period and (*) culture, and that the emphasis on recovering only the original intent of the author was flawed, as one should focus on the fusion between the author and reader's situations.

This caused Plato to add the criterion, "having broad nails." He was exiled after being accused along with his father of "defacing the currency," which he saw as a metaphor for the evil of custom. When asked where he was (*) from, this philosopher replied, "I am a citizen of the world," and is thus credited with the first use of the word "cosmopolitan."

Jacques Derrida used the example of masturbation to illustrate his reworking of this thinker's concept of the supplement. Paul de Man analyzed Derrida's reading of this thinker in "The Rhetoric of Blindness." One of his essays postulates that pity is a social quality distinct from compassion that was given to man to balance out his egocentrism. That essay claims that society originated when a man first (*) fenced in a piece of land and said "This is mine."

In one paper titled for this concept, a thinker uses a thought experiment in which we ask John Updike a series of questions about Rabbit Angstrom to model interpersonal interactions. That paper argues treating this concept as a concrete object would be a category mistake, calling it a "theorist's fiction." Part 3 of Reasons and Persons describes the branch-line thought experiment, which induces a "fission" in this concept, to illustrate that this concept is not what matters. It's not the future, but in a work titled for this concept, the thinker rewrites a thought experiment in the second person to argue against a (*) memory-based conception of it. Bernard Williams included that rebuke alongside a paper on "ethical consistency" in his work titled for "The Problems of [this concept]," and Daniel Dennett described this concept as a "center of narrative gravity."

The author of this work laments that it is not the princes, but the philosophers of his time who believe that philosophy should not be taught because there is no monetary value. This work notes that our understanding of the Peripatetics would be limited without the Academy of Platonists in a section that argues that we must synthesize and explore multiple philosophical schools to grasp the "light of (*) truth." This work describes the Seraph, Cherub, and Throne to illustrate a progression through which one could become angelic, as we are stuck in the middle between the earth and the heavens.

Nikolas Kompridis introduced the idea of reflective disclosure to critique Habermas' formulation of this concept. In the first volume of Theory of Communicative Action, Habermas claims that this concept has been subjugated to the use of formal systems that objectify individuals. He then aims to establish a "communicative" understanding of this concept. In a book partially titled for this concept, Horkheimer discussed the limitations of American pragmatism and described how the Nazis were able to push their agenda onto Germany. That book defines the (*) instrumental variety of this concept. An essay by Kant outlines "public" and "private" uses of this concept and claims that freedom is the ability to publicly exercise this faculty.

In a section on types, this work notes that two errors human beings make are taking everything literally and taking everything figuratively. It distinguishes between the "mathematical" and the "intuitive" mind in its first part, which addresses "Mind and Style." This work argues that (*) Miracles and Truth are necessary, for it is how both the body and soul are satisfied.

This work begins by noting how although we are acquainted with the concept of the "center of mass of the Solar System," it is something else to have knowledge about it. This work, which was published in Mind and can be found in its author's Logic and Knowledge, refutes the ideas of Meinong and Frege by proposing that the complexity of meaning has no bearing on the title quality.

The man who first posited these events claimed that they are invisible due to a "misconstruction of texts," even though these events induce polarization, which in turn leads to a failure of political recourse. These events do not discard vocabulary needlessly, and like evolution they do not have an end goal in mind. That formulator pointed out that this event does not occur in literature due to the inherent pluralism in its study. These events are distinguished from gestalt switches in that it is impossible for a fact to be correct again. Imre Lakatos argued that they only occur once a belief has been fully dogmatized, and they are distinguished from normal discovery.

That expositor of this man claims that this man's concept of phusis can be rendered as "self-blossoming." This thinker's surviving work contains fragments like "the mysteries practiced among men are unholy mysteries" and "great deaths win greater portions." Octavio Paz's The Bow and the Lyre takes its title from another one of this man's writings, which are often uninterpretable, which is why this man is called the "Obscure Philosopher." He's not Parmenides, but the University of Freiburg Lectures delivered by Fink and Heidegger were expositions of his thought.

A definitive study of this work is Stephen Buckle's monograph, which is subtitled "the unity and purpose of [this work]." This work argues that no theory of will can provide an intuition of the natural science's concepts of energy or work, and it cites Alexander the False Prophet and Cato as part of its three reasons against the validity of "testimony," but its author claims that a fourth reason is that testimony about the fantastic is inherently self-defeating. This work defends the notions of chance in its short section "Of Probability" and borrows from John Locke to call colors "complex ideas." This work discusses natural connections in order to provide a coherent account of the author's own theory of causation.

In 1892 this thinker published the first of a series of five essays for The Monist which notes that  Law and Chance have always been diametrically opposed before arguing that classical mechanics must fail on the atomic level. An 1881 paper by this author of The Architecture of Theories proved the completeness of Boolean algebra from the "Not And" operator alone. Another essay by this man asks the reader to form a conception of the definition of the word "hard" then a definition of the word "weight" before outlining how equivalent paths have the same beginning and end points. That essay by this logician uses a geometric way of calculating forces to argue that even though we know what is force, it is something we do not understand.

David Abram defined one of this thinker's concepts as a matrix that gives rise to the perceiver and the perceived and is useful in imagining a sensible landscape that cannot be sensed. That concept, which is the word chair and is often translated as "the flesh," appears in the last chapter of a work by this thinker which discusses "the intertwining-the chiasm." Another work by this man argues that Descartes's quote "cogito ergo sum" fails to explain consciousness and partially resolves that problem by suggesting a notion of "bodily space" and "external space." That work proposes that the objective world is a field of the second title concept, which transcends both sensation and interpretation.

Jacques Bossuet defended his Divine Right Argument by writing a discourse which claims the common man has no use for this entity, but the monarch favored by God does. One essay that attempted to elucidate this entity cites the subtitle figure's influence from Joseph de Maistre and notes that a certain Russian thinker tried to combine this entity with mathematical calculus. Another thinker who attempted to define this thing partitioned it into three parts: original, reflexive and philosophical. That work begins with the claim that Reason is the only way of understanding this entity. Isaiah Berlin's The Hedgehog and the Fox is an essay on Leo Tolstoy's conception of it, and a general introduction to Hegel's views that discusses India and China are some lectures on this.

Its preface claims that this work at times will seem to vacillate between two contradictory hypotheses: one is that society will be able to contain itself, and the other is that containment will force society to explode. In the last part of its first section, this work uses a pair of analyses on the labor of the Hawthorne Works of the Western Electric Company to argue that language is altered by the media in order to make radical thought impossible. This work cites "The Closing of the Universe of Discourse" and "The Closing of the Political Universe" as ways in which modern society is being formed. This work posits that negative thinking is a necessity against positivism and attacks consumerism by outlining a plan for a "Great Refusal."

The first refutation of this work was written by Jakob Thomasius, the teacher of Leibniz, and is titled "On the Liberation of Philosophy." In one section of this treatise, the author posits the understanding of a text is only done correctly by locating the sensus literalis. The seventeenth section posits that faith is the accepting of facts that make God believable, and Cudworth's True Intellectual System of the Universe attacks this work's sixth section "On Miracles." This treatise begins with a section analyzing prophecy, which culminates in the claim that Moses did not write the first five books of the Bible.

One of this 20th century philosopher's works offers the reader a way out of the "labyrinth of error" by offering a spiritual life that is disillusion. That work critiqued the ideas of Dean Inge and is called Platonism and the Spiritual Life. Another work by this thinker claims "In natural philosophy, I am a decided materialist." That work ranks Democritus as the most relevant thinker of all time and Aristotle second, before equating pantheism with atheism and arguing that the title entity is based upon science. Another work by this thinker posits three ways of overcoming illusion, which allows the human mind to reach a concept this thinker terms "essence." That work argues against dogmatism and posits "one more system of philosophy" that is inspired by this man's Catholicism. That work's second title concept is simply the assumption of existence, which leads to the conclusion that "philosophy begins in medias res."

This thinker explained in his autobiography that one of his crises was resolved after a ray of light from God struck his breast. That ray was used as a metaphor to reject all facts which were not obtained from "sensory experience" or "necessary experience," which led him to abandon the natural sciences. He thus championed a method that begins with dhawq, which is the beginning of the hal frame of mind. That method of knowledge obtained through mystic contemplation appears in a work of this thinker's that divides the titular group into materialists, naturalists, and theists, the latter of which includes Plato and this man's predecessor Avicenna.

One essay about this concept argues that those who search for it forge "masterpieces of deception." That essay about this concept asks whether or not language is an adequate expression of all realities. In that work, it is argued that people who possess this quality will always trade it for illusions, and that this thing is a "movable host of metaphors and metonymies." In a book for free spirits, one maxim by the same thinker about this concept paradoxically notes that calling this entity "simple" is a compound lie. This concept is anthropomorphized and given a female characteristic at the beginning of another work to compare past philosophers to inept dogmatists. This concept was discussed in a "non-moral sense" in one essay, and Nietzsche once asked us to suppose this "were a woman, what then?"

This thinker claimed that human life is characterized by a discrepancy between pretension and reality, which is the title concept of his essay "The Absurd." A collection of essays by this man is prefaced with a work that analyzes how philosophy's problems arise from the objective and the subjective viewpoint, leading this thinker to propose the titular construct. This thinker extended a Bernard Williams concept in formulating resultant, circumstantial, constitutive, and causal types of "moral luck." In another essay, this thinker who wrote The View from Nowhere claimed that "Consciousness is what makes the mind-body problem really intractable" and that essay offers a physicalist view of the subjectivity of consciousness.

This thinker determined three roles for a person who enters a group as its third member and claimed that three was the smallest number under which a group as a whole could impose its will on individuals. In another essay, this man claims "extremities and peculiarities" are produced and exaggerated to preserve an individual's awareness of himself in the face of impersonal market forces. That essay explains how rapidly-changing stimuli and an impersonal market cause people of the title locale to become purely rational and analyzes fashion in order to examine social relation in the first title place. In another work, this thinker argued that the title substance is a symbol and functions as an objectified measure of value.

This thinker, who is not Searle, used an interaction with a grocer to introduce the notion of (*) brute facts. This thinker analyzed the discrepancies between what a man buys and what is on his shopping list in a work that John Searle called one of the best explanations of "direction of fit."

David Chalmers argued against traditional interpretations of this position, claiming that we needed a "new law of nature" while defining a "naturalistic" formulation of this position. One philosopher would ultimately come to reject a form of this position he originally defended in the paper "Epiphenomenal Qualia," in which he proposed the knowledge argument in support of this position. Modern philosophers of this position generally adhere to the "predicate" or (*) "property" form of this position, which faces the problem of "causal interaction."

This philosopher authored a text on education that warned readers not to teach children "inert ideas," which are disjointed or unhelpful facts that have no application to culture or real life. Michel Weber is an interpreter of this philosopher who titled a text after this philosopher's "pancreativism." This author of "The Aims of Education" defined a unit that was called "all window" in contrast to Leibniz's "windowless" monads.

This thinker began his career by attacking Rousseau's views on language, in an appendix to his translation of the second Discourse. He hypothesized that hieroglyphics naturally lead to idolatry, and thus it required an enormous, possibly divinely granted leap, to transition to modern alphabets. He argued for separation of church and state by noting that the former only has "imperfect" rights and no powers of coercion; thus, "the power of religion is love and beneficence," as opposed to the state's "physical power." This thinker's most famous book begins by analyzing how Hobbes and Locke tried to protect "liberty of conscience" from the state, and then argues that Christianity's unprovable dogmas inherently repress that liberty. This philosopher attacked Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi's pantheist version of (*) Spinoza in To Lessing's Friends.

The most famous book about this concept has been criticized for its exclusive focus on written, as opposed to visual and artistic sources, as well as its restriction to a "little flock" or "family" of people. Characters like Erasmus and Lucian debate over this concept in The Bridge of Criticism. A book about this concept famously includes almost three hundred pages of "bibliographical essay," and includes a detailed study of Lichtenberg's notebooks and Wieland's poetry. That book finds a precursor to this concept in ancient Rome, which is placed in "dialectical" opposition to Christian (*) "mysticism." That book analyzes this concept as key to the "emancipation of art" from crafts, which proceeded from the rise of "good taste."

This thinker attacked the liberal middle class's self-praise for promoting the culture it designates as "authentic" in the essay "The Affirmative Character of Culture." This thinker argued that equal presentations of opposing opinions are inherently oppressive, so a "liberating" or "discriminating tolerance" would therefore not tolerate the arguments of the right. This thinker said that the ultimate goal of socialism should be to be to turn the struggle for existence into a "rationality of gratification" which united work and (*) leisure.

This dialogue employs a metaphor involving the stone of Heraclea to illustrate how, much like objects that have been magnetized can in turn magnetize other objects, so abilities imparted by (*) divinities to men are spread via a chain. In this dialogue, Socrates concludes that the title character has no special skill and must be possessed by a Muse when he practices his art, partly because he's bored by all creators of that art except Homer.

This thinker ranked paintings of still lives below genre and historical painting since they offer more pure aesthetic pleasure and less objectification of the essence of life. This thinker's view of aesthetics was centered around a (*) hierarchy of the arts which placed music at the top, since he believed it to be a direct articulation of his concept of the inner nature of our being.

In Grice's theory of meaning, the speaker must have this concept with respect to the hearer recognizing a prior instance of this concept. In an example identifying the actions of turning on a light and alerting a prowler, Davidson noted whether an action has this property may change with description, and then analyzed this concept as a way to describe actions in terms of their reasons.

That people accrue credit for the virtues they display is one solution to the value problem of this concept. Stanley and Williamson have argued against a distinction between two types of this concept, which was argued for by claiming the absence of one type would require considering infinitely many propositions before taking action, and was proposed by Ryle.

The "full-blooded" form of this theory doesn't privilege any single universe, instead advocating plenitude. One argument against this theory advocates structuralism, and claims there can be no objects with only structural properties. Another argument against this theory is that the non-causal objects it posits cannot account for the reliability of its subject. Frege argued for this theory by claiming that for statements to be true, the singular terms appearing in them must exist, similar to the Putnam-Quine indispensability thesis argument for this theory. Formalism, which directly opposes this theory, claims its subject proceeds purely by syntactic transformations, as exemplified by Hilbert's treatment of geometry.

Contextualists such as DeRose resolve the problem posed by this theory by claiming standards change with conversational context. Dretske argued against this theory with an example considering whether zebras in a zoo were really mules. That argument against this theory was expanded on by the non-justified-true-belief definition of knowledge in Nozick's tracking theory, in which certain claims track truth but their entailments need not, and so denies the deductive closure principle. One argument against a formulation of this theory used the causal theory of reference to argue that words would refer to objects-in-the-image, and thus this claim couldn't even be properly formulated. The "Here is one hand" argument by Moore was meant to refute this theory with respect to the external world.

Arguing that  this concept only holds at a given instant, Lewis claimed that intrinsic changeable properties vanish if perdurance theory is denied. There are several puzzles concerning how to apply this concept to Tibbles the cat and the tail-complement Tibs.

Dummett used this property to disprove strict finitism in "Wang's Paradox". Williamson has argued that if this property can be iterated twice, it can be iterated indefinitely, while discussing its "higher order" form. By examining a proof parallel to Kripke's refutation of contingent identities, where this property plays the role of contingency, Evans argued that objects could not have this property. Considering the propositions "The blob is pink" and "The blob is red", Fine argued that penumbral truths cannot be respected by a truth-value account of this property, and, like Russell, used supervaluationism, claiming propositions with this property might be neither true nor false. The epistemic view claims that predicates with this property have an unknowable  threshold. For 10 points, name this property exemplified by "being a heap" in the Sorites paradox, possessed by predicates with borderline cases.

Topic-neutral analyses were introduced to explain secondary qualities in this theory. In a paper arguing for this theory, it was claimed epiphenomenal states would be "nomological danglers" off of normal causal chains. Lewis put forth a form of this theory where mental concepts are non-rigid after claiming the usual form of this theory accounts for mad, but not Martian, pain. Since anomalous monism is non-reductive, it is an example of the "token" type of this theory. The third lecture of Naming and Necessity presents the modal argument against this theory, claiming it requires contingent equality of rigid designators. The argument against this theory from multiple realizability led to it being largely replaced by functionalism. For 10 points, the claim that pain is just C-fibers firing is an example of what theory claiming mental states are just brain processes?

The "active" form of this principle was introduced using the example of Otto, who must consult his notebook to find a museum. The compatibility of this principle with self-knowledge has been argued both for and against by slow-switching arguments, which require that somebody unknowingly changes worlds. In one argument for this principle, Jane claims to have arthritis in her thigh, despite really having tharthritis. Another paper, arguing for the semantic rather than content form of this principle, introduces division of linguistic labor to explain an example about the inability to distinguish a beach from an elm, which appears after an example that uses the fact that "water" is a rigid designator, and thus doesn't refer to XYZ. For 10 points, name this principle argued for in the Twin Earth thought experiment, summarized as "meanings just ain't in the head".

These propositions are treated as anaphors in van der Sandt's adoption of binding theory. These propositions were defined to be satisfied at some point if they would be left-redundant when added at that point, in a paper classifying embeddings as plugs, holes, or filters. Gazdar defined the potential type of these propositions, which might not become the actual type due to cancellation. The accommodation of these propositions occurs when one is added to the common ground, thus requiring an update to the context set of possible worlds. The projection problem is to determine the rules for inheritance of these propositions, and their preservation under operators such as negation distinguishes them from entailments. For 10 points, name these propositions taken for granted in a conversation.

One theory of this device accounts for its mixed form by claiming it points to an expression in use. That theory by Davidson claimed this device functions as a demonstrative pointing to a particular expression-token. The reason this device introduces an opaque context can be explained by the theory that it gives a proper name of an expression, but that theory doesn't account for the similarity between the name and the expression named. A formula is evaluated before applying this device in Quine's "corner" form of it. This device is generally taken to show an expression is mentioned, rather than used. For 10 points, name this device used to refer to a sequence of characters contained between namesake punctuation, rather than whatever those characters may mean, such as when saying what someone else has said.

Strawson argued Austin's definition of this concept had a type-error, since one of the terms in a relation he used could not be things in the world. Dummett claimed the realist/anti-realist debate concerns a property of this concept. By showing how an infinite regress of premises, each explaining how to apply the previous ones, would be required for any argument, Quine challenged Carnap's conventionalist view of this concept. Since reference is more remote than this concept when performing radical interpretation, Davidson suggested meaning should be based on a theory of this concept instead, particularly on the Convention T of Tarski's inductively-defined semantic theory, which holds open-quote Snow is white close-quote has this property if and only if snow is white. For 10 points, correspondence theories hold a proposition has what property if it matches the state of the world?

Peacocke argued against one theory of this phenomenon using an example of two trees at different distances. This phenomenon is analogized to fame in a theory claiming it occurs from probes elevating certain content. An objection to one theory of this phenomenon asks why rocks do not obtain it when someone has a belief about them, and is meant to counter the "higher order" theory of it. Transparency of experience is used to argue this phenomenon is fully exhausted by representational properties. A criterion for one type of this phenomenon is reportability, and that "access" type is available for use in reasoning, as opposed to the "phenomenal" type. The "explanatory gap" is the inability to explain this phenomenon from physical facts, and "What is It Like to Be a Bat" used its subjectivity to argue against physicalist theories it.

This concept's namesake Markov condition gives a nice factorization of any distribution generated by an acyclic model with appropriate error terms. Woodward gave conditions for when fixing the value of a variable gives an intervention, which is used to correct problems with the notion of free agency used in manipulability theories of this phenomenon. Many theories of this phenomenon have preemption counterexamples, where one agent's actions precede and negate another's. Another theory of this phenomenon uses comparative similarity to define the "closer to actuality" relation, and excludes the use of backtracking counterfactuals, where the consequent occurs before the antecedent. For 10 points, by that theory of Lewis, E1 bears what relation to E2 if, were E1 not to occur, then E2 would not occur either?

Prior proposed a solution to this problem by taking the disjunction of two types of statements, considering an example about tea-drinking in England and shooting New Zealanders. Hare's argument against one solution to this problem uses the example of a baseball game to claim rules require a game to be played, so those rules don't apply outside the game itself. That solution to this problem was Searle's, and considers the promise of Smith to pay $5 dollars, claiming that promises tautologically create obligations. Naturalist solutions to this problem were refuted by the open question argument, which claimed the statement "A is good" is unanalyzable, and so the obligation to do good is insufficient. For 10 points, name this problem, sometimes called Hume's guillotine, of deriving prescriptive statements from descriptive ones.

The extrinsicness problem for this phenomenon arises under externalism because states can represent different things when embedded in different contexts. One problem about this phenomenon for role functionalism is that that theory would contradict Hume's dictum by positing necessary effects. The dual explanandum account of this phenomenon is challenged by Kim's supervenience argument. That argument is an extension of an another against accounts of this phenomenon, which shows the completeness of physics and nonoverdetermination lead to epiphenominalism. The exclusion argument could be resolved by identity theory, since then this phenomenon reduces to purely physical interactions. For 10 points, name this phenomenon by which the mind affects the world.

Kripke claimed to resolve a critique of this theory by distinguishing between speaker's reference and semantic reference. Using the examples of a detective seeing the corpse of Smith, and seeing a man on trial for Smith's murder, Donnellan claimed this theory could only explain attributive, rather than referential, use. Strawson critiqued this theory for conflating expressions and their use, and for entailing, rather than presupposing, existential statements. Another critique of this theory considers the idea that Godel may have been a fraud, and points out that the central expressions are not rigid, unlike names. This theory used quantifiers in the logical form of negative existentials to explain how we seem to refer to non-existent objects.  For 10 points, name this theory suggesting "the author of Waverley" be substituted for "Scott", presented in "On Denoting" by Russell.

A critique of this theory, in which new evidence that murder suspect Mr. Dunnit has a twin removes an alibi, tried to show its namesake concept is not truth-conducive. One philosopher addressed the objection that this theory requires an infinite regress of metabeliefs with his Doxastic presumption, and introduced cognitively spontaneous beliefs to answer the isolation objection that this theory could endorse a system with no experiential grounding. The alternative systems objection notes there may be several systems for which this theory's namesake value is equal. In introducing virtue epistemology, Sosa compared this theory to a raft, as opposed to the pyramid of foundationalism. This theory dissolves the regress problem for justification by denying it makes sense to justify individual beliefs.

This concept undergoes revision via a partial meet contraction of remainders in the AGM model. Playing on the name of this concept, Gendler introduced a related concept that directly activates behavioral responses, with examples such as the unwillingness to drink from a new bedpan. This concept is completely based on a tarot reading in Lehrer's gypsy-lawyer counterexample to causal accounts of the basing relation, which holds between an instance of this concept and the reason for it. A paper titled after this concept argues that certain problems for Millianism also appear for definite descriptions, by using translation and disquotation in place of substitution, and considers the proposition "Londres est jolie". In Quine's scientific holism, the rules of logic occupy a central place in our "web of" this concept. For 10 points, the scientific method was claimed by Peirce to be the best method for the "fixation of" what concept?

In a 2002 paper, this thinker described the importance of scope, intensity and probability in calculating existential risk.  This co-founder of the World Transhumanist Association and formulator of the Simulation hypothesis outlined the concept of a "Great Filter" that keeps the "billions  of potential germination points for life" from blossoming in his essay, "Where Are They?

This author considered three ontological dimensions to the human body, the last being myself as a body known by the Other. The first two dimensions correspond to two general categories of being which this author named en-soi and pour-soi, the former unchanging and the latter dynamic and associated with consciousness.

Its second section declares that middle-class marriage is merely a system in which men "take the greatest pleasure in seducing each other's wives." This book's first section argues that "all that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned" because of the rise of a social class that requires constantly revolutionizing the means of production.

This book identifies stoicism, skepticism, and the "unhappy consciousness" as phases through which the idea of consciousness develops. Alexander Kojve (koh-JEV) discussed a struggle for recognition presented in this text in his book on "Reading [this work's author]."
