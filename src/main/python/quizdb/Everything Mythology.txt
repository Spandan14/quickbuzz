Worship of the local deity in Hiw or Diopolis Parva was so associated with this object, that in later periods, the name of the city translated to "Domain of" this object. Henry George Fischer has argued that the similar appearance of this object and the fetish of the cow-horned, human-faced goddess Bat  resulted in that goddess's absorption by Hathor, whose son Ihy played this instrument in her own cult. Playing of this instrument accompanied the arrival of Isis and her retinue at the birth of Iphis in Ovid's Metamorphoses and in Book VIII of the Aeneid, Cleopatra appears on Aeneas's shield spurring her forces on with this "national" instrument, associated with Isis's cult in Rome. This instrument typically came in two forms: the "naos" variety, which is designed to look like a temple or house, and a variety most associated with Hathor because of her horns which consists of a U-shaped piece of metal holding between two and four thin rods, each with small clanging disks on them.
