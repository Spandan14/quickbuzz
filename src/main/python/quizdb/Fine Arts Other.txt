In an essay on these events, Susan Sontag wrote that one can only cherish them as one does a firecracker going off dangerously close to one's face. One of these events began with the building of a wooden tower and a nest of saplings and strings, but devolved in the burning of a car off of whose hood women licked strawberry jam. That event was famously photographed by Sol Goldberg and took place at Cornell. In one of these events that took place at the Judson Memorial Church, a man pretended to kill himself using a cardboard gun and flailed around in trash while wearing only rags. Unlike those called Household and Snapshots from the (*) City, many of these events were performed at Claes Oldenburg's Ray Gun Theater.

Four years after the unveiling of this sculpture's best-known version, an altered plaster version was exhibited at the Pan-American Exhibition.

Pablo Casals appears with his back turned to the camera, playing his cello, in one portrait by this artist. A shadow bears down on the subject of another portrait by this photographer, whose slightly down-turned face and stern look are reportedly the result of this photographer removing a cigar from that subject's mouth a moment before the photo was taken. That photo, shot in 1941, depicts a man in a black three-piece suit, with his left arm akimbo and his right hand resting on the back of a chair.

The Bergen Record was the first newspaper to carry one photo depicting this action, which was shot by Thomas Franklin and depicts this action being performed by three Brooklyn firefighters. Another photo depicting this image was altered by the photographer to remove a wrist watch from the arm of one participant, in order to downplay that man's looting, and to add more smoke to the sky, in order to appear as though this action was occurring during an on-going battle. One photographer caught two examples of this action in front of an eagle at the Templehof Airport and over the Quadriga atop the Brandenburg Gate, but those examples are less famous than a picture of this event that photographer, Yevgeny Khaldei, took atop the Reichstag.

In one picture by this photographer, a girl in a white dress closes her eyes and tilts her head back as she twists her tendril-like arms, each holding eggs, around one another. This photographer of Nancy shot photos of an overweight woman looking to the right with her mouth wide open and of a grizzled, leonine man wearing a sign. Both Yawning Woman and Sandwich Man were likely shot, as was a photo of a woman with one closed eye and another staring off to the side while wearing a sign that reads "blind", using this photographer's false lens. A barn shaded by an unseen tree and a white house appear partially blurred in the background of a photo by this photographer, which focuses on the title object in the foreground.

A bronze statue in this style, with the head looking slightly down and to the right and the right arm extended with open palm, was discovered in 1959 by sewer workers in the Piraeus.

In 2008, the group Atelier Bow-Wow released a manifesto stating that a "void" form of this movement can counteract the haphazard fashion of "single-family houses and small buildings." The original-language name for this movement literally means "replacing the old with the new" and was outlined after its first members gathered at the World Design Conference and learned about the ideas behind the Richards Medical Research Laboratories of Louis Kahn. An artist suggested that this movement's "changing requirements of the contemporary age" could be met by attaching "pods" to enormous cylinders, and putting them into the ocean to create a "Marine City." Though many of the founders of this movement were concerned with creating "megastructures," only a few buildings from this movement were realized, such as the still-standing Nakagin Capsule Tower.
