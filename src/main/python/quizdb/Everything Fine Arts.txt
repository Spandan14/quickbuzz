This work's third section posits three forms of money: governmental, conventional, and shadow-world, and suggests that they all lead to "cataclysmic, rather than gradual" changes. This work warns against the presence of bars and theatres in low-density "grey areas" and suggests that long streets diminish the intensity and intricacy of the foreground. This work suggests that storekeepers serve as self-appointed public characters who provide "eye protection," providing children with a safe non-matriarchal play environment for children. That public security is only possible if the streets are always occupied, which requires mixed-use neighborhoods, which are advocated in this work.

Both the sculptor's biographer Baldinucci and the sculptor's son Domenico claim that they were the models for this work, which was created for Cardinal Scipione Borghese and still lies in the Galleria Borghese. This work departs from textual tradition by showing a harp at the title figure's feet, and during its composition, Maffeo Barberini, who later patronized this work's creator after becoming Pope Urban VIII, would hold a mirror up for this work's artist so he could model it after himself.

Reynaldo Hahn claimed that the most celebrated moment of this piece was suggested by a passage in Saint-Saens' work of the same genre in D minor, and its creator noted in his dedication to Jacques de Lacretelle that the tremolos that precede that passage were inspired by the Prelude to Lohengrin. Themes from this work are quoted and developed in the same composer's later Septet, which its creator admitted was modeled on Franck's String Quartet, and which was discovered after the composer's death by his daughter's lesbian lover, who had proposed spitting on his portrait in an earlier scene of the work in which this piece appears. That Septet receives a notable performance by an ensemble including Charles Morel in the salon of the Verdurin's, the same location where the "little phrase" from this piece first makes its impression on a character that interprets it as the "national anthem" of his love for Odette Crecy, Charles Swann.

The coda to this piece's second movement sees the orchestra play a tutti sixty-fourth note run that destabilizes the steady theme rhythm of the rest of the movement. Gustav Mahler reorchestrated one movement of this piece to make the theme more prominent in the recapitulation, and that movement contains a surprising shift into the submediant key of D instead of the dominant. A forte C-sharp in octaves interrupts the opening pianissimo theme of its final movement. The first and last measures of this composition's first movement are exactly the same, and the fff ("fortiss-issimo") recapitulation eliminates the piano fifth through eighth measures of the opening theme.

Hans von Bulow called this work a "law unto itself," and the composer of this work claimed that he put the piece together from a couple of entr'actes. The recapitulation of the first movement begins with this work's only marking of 3 p's. In the opening of this work, the violins play only in descending thirds and ascending sixths, though the woodwinds imitate those figures as chords, while the piccolo and triangle only play in the allegro giocoso third movement. The aforementioned chains of falling thirds allude to the composer's song "O Death," while the fourth movement of this work is a set of thirty-two variations on the cantata Nach dir, Herr, verlanget mich, originally thought to be composed by J.S. Bach. For 10 points, identify this work by the composer of the Academic Festival Overture which followed three others of the same genre.

Reclining figures in this work are modeled after allegorical nude figures in the Medici Chapel. A study on Michelangelo's statue of Samson and the Philistines provided the basis for a red-clad soldier with his back to the viewer, and a woman in orange holding a baby on the far left of this work may be based on drawings of Sistine Chapel sybils. In the right background of this painting, two figures stand in the doorway of a temple decorated with caryatids and two reclining female figures, and two dark-skinned men lean over a balcony in the left background. A man in blue on his knees holds a stake over the central figure, and a man in a turban holds up a broken chisel and turns to the right of this painting. Broken ropes, stakes, and axes lie around a prostrate and naked title figure, while a notably foreshortened orange-cloaked figure clasps a book while hovering above.

One character in this story describes "placid corpses" floating in the Benares "bloated up like sunfish." That character later taunts another for fearing his entire body will become a "vagina in heat," and that character treasures a Georges Batailles photograph of a man being drawn and quartered. The phrase "a certain party" is used to refer to a man after his son is shot for desertion, about two years before a failed August 16th rebellion during which the fighters sing the titular Bach cantata. This work opens with its narrator throwing a pair of nostril hair clippers at a dwarfen lunatic who has crept into the hospital room where he lies dying of imaginary liver cancer. Mocking the right-wing politics of Yukio Mishima, this story is one of four in a collection that also includes Prize Stock, Aghwee the Sky Monster, and the tale that nicknames the narrator's brain-damaged son Eeyore, "Teach Us to Outgrow Our Madness."

Brass and winds are played in short bursts of eighth notes over flashes of string to mimic laughter during its "Grotesque Dance of Dorcon." In addition to featuring fifteen distinct percussion instruments, a wordless chorus can be heard throughout this work. The second section begins with the exhausting "warrior's dance" and ends with a divinely aided rescue from a pirate camp. A series of parallel fourths in the horns and a triplet pattern in the solo flute represent three statues coming to life in a sacred grotto during its opening. Its epilogue, featuring a group of women playing tambourines in a manic 5/4 rhythm and dressed as bacchantes, is preceded by the reunited title characters dancing a duet in honor of Syrinx and Pan.

This composer of Dinorah saw his early opera Jephtha flop, and Gaetano Rossi wrote the libretto to one of his works in which Armando rescues the sultan from Osmino and which includes a castrato role, Il crociato in Egitto. This composer of Margaret of Anjou also collaborated with Rossi on an opera in which the title characters both love Teobaldo, Romilda and Costanza.

On the left a man in a Green coat and a sash made out of beads bends towards the central group. Another figure's embroidered hat lies in front of him as he clenches his fists, while another man clutches a large flag. Completed two years after its artist's more conventional depiction of Agrippina Landing at Brundisium, the artist defended his decision to depict "the modern garb of war."This, however, did not exclude its artist from taking historical license, for neither the wounded Robert Monckton nor the pensive and crouching American Indian were there when the titular event occurred.

Three times in this work, the music suddenly stops. Its second movement introduces a gentle oboe solo, while it opens with an orchestral depiction of an urban landscape which is interrupted by a clarinet solo and the beginning of a group of sections that its creator identified as "decoy games." Its composer was inspired to begin this work while reading Menyhert Lengel's namesake tale, in which a young girl is forced to wave at passersby from a window. In this musical adaptation, it is the girl's seductive dancing that results in the quick robbery of an old rake and a young man, which occurs before three loud trombone crashes symbolize the entrance of a more formidable, foreign character. Written on the heels of its composer's The Wooden Prince, cymbals mark the three consecutive unsuccessful attempts on the titular figure's life.

Painted during the artist's time at Uylenburgh's workshop, it depicts an event that took place on January 31 of the same year that another figure in this work was punished for committing armed robbery. Its namesake was well known in his time for publishing a work describing the then unknown symptoms of Beri-Beri. That subject is surrounded by a group of black-clad onlookers, wears a large floppy hat, and holds a pair of forceps over the flayed arm of a man stretched out on a table.

This work originally contained a soprano line setting Stefan George's translation of Baudelaire's poem De Profundis Clamavi in its final movement marked Largo Desolato. It ends with a melancholy movement where Tristan and Isolde is briefly quoted in the cello. The lengths of various sections and metronome markings are largely dictated by manipulations of the numbers 23 and 10, and the sequence A, B-flat, B, F is derived from the names of the subjects. It takes its title from a work composed by Alexander von Zemlinsky, and along with the Kammerkonzert, it marks the composer's transition to use of the twelve-tone system.

That opera by Hans Pfitzner sees this work recovered by its composer's pupil Silla and his son Ighino. Its composer structured the longer movements homophonically and deployed a slow contrapuntal technique. This work, which was first played at Cardinal Vitellozzi's home, included a dedication letter detailing its composer's "novo modorum genere", or "new stylistic approach." Its last section is scored for a countertenor and a treble rather than a tenor, and that section, the Agnus Dei, is in two parts rather than three. Its Kyrie and Sanctus were written to show that imitation didn't have to obscure the content of the words and was presented to the Council of Trent.

He painted a young woman nodding off at the wheel in The Sleeping Spinner, while Meyer Schapiro suggested that he was influenced by images d'Epinal, prints circulated in the countryside, in an essay on this man and "popular imagery." That influence can be seen in the frieze-like composition of Enterrement and in his self-styling as the Wandering Jew in The Meeting. An extrovert, he depicted himself in numerous works such as Self-portrait with a dog and Self-portrait as a desparate man. He created a painting of two naked women cavorting in Sleep and he called his close-up of Jo Hiffernan's genitals The Origin of the World.

One of his works depicts a Cross of the Order of St. Michael and a small plaster statue of Pigalle scattered among objects on a table. That piece, Attributes of the Arts, was painted a few years before this artist's failing vision caused him to turn primarily to working in pastels. Though he had no students of his own, his influence on subsequent painters, such as Lucian Freud, who made multiple copies of his The Schoolmistress, may be attributed to his use of short parallel strokes that built up layers of pigment.His earliest success, depicting a bristling cat next to a gutted fish, The Ray, was followed by notable half length portraits of children including Girl with a Shuttlecock and a picture depicting Monsieur Lenoir's Son Building a House of Cards.

During the Hellenistic period, the millefiori technique was developed, allowing people to create intricate designs in it.

Unusual features of this work include the built-up diminished seventh and the conclusion, which includes a minor plagal cadence, a detail that indicates a possibly faulty transcription or even a wrong attribution to the composer by the transcriber Johann Ringk. Peter Williams places the work a fifth higher, so that the famous opening is in E and the dominant key is A minor, because he believes it to be originally a composition for violin that had been transcribed to its usual instrument.
