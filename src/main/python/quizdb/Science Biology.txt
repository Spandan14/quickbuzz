One theory named for this adjective underlies a function which gives the probability that a newly sampled individual is of a new species; that “species generator” relies on a diversity parameter, theta, which equals 2 times the metacommunity population times the rate of speciation. That theory named for this word predicts species abundances using stochastic processes and was developed by Stephen Hubbell. In another theory named for this word, the probability of fixation equals 1 over 2N, but the probability increases by assuming events which "strictly" have this property instead "nearly" have it.

One of these proteins called PHA-L can be used as a molecular tracer which can cross synapses in anterograde tracing studies.

Mutations in parC and parE can confer resistance to this class of compounds, as can mutations in the QRDR region of another protein.

Wu and Ting found that the Odysseus gene in various Drosophila species can mediate this phenomenon, and genes that mediate this phenomenon can be found using introgression. One model for this phenomenon was partly supported by the work of Barbash, who found the interacting pair of genes Hmr and Lhr. In various Xiphophorus species, this phenomenon occurs by spots on the fins turning into tumors due to misregulation of the Xmrk-2 gene. Coyne and Orr were the first to map several factors that contribute to this phenomenon in three different lines of Drosophila. This phenomenon requires mutations in at least two genetic loci according to a model developed by (*) Dobzhansky and Muller.

Mutation of the receptor for this hormone causes Donohue syndrome. Mutations in either this hormone or KCNJ11 cause the “permanent neonatal” version of one disease. Cone snails use a version of this hormone as venom. Its receptor is downregulated by PTPN1. This hormone’s receptor activates IRS-1, which in turn activates PI-3-Kinase and PKB. Growth hormone triggers the release of a growth factor similar to this hormone, also called somatomedin C. This hormone, six molecules of which are coordinated to zinc in a vesicle, has derivatives called glargine and detemir. A lack of this hormone can cause ketoacidosis, and this hormone increases fat and glycogen synthesis. For 10 points, name this hormone created by the beta cells of the Islets of Langerhans.

The Kosambi mapping function is one popular way to estimate the extent of this effect as it contains a correction term for certain “double” events. During a selective sweep, allele frequencies of nearby polymorphisms can also be altered due to this phenomenon; that effect is genetic hitchhiking. One value used to measure this phenomenon is calculated as a log ratio of recombination fractions of marker and disease loci. Fine mapping in GWA studies typically allow imputation of non-genotyped SNPs thanks to this effect with the tag SNP.

An observation that this phenomenon occurs with constant probability through time led Leigh Van Valen to propose the Red Queen hypothesis.
