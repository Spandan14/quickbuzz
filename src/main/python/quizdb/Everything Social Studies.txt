A framework for calculating risk capital for a firm by using the cost of its implicit guarantees to its subsidiaries was developed by Perold and this economist. The Jarrow-Turnbull model uses random interest rates to extend the framework of this man's namesake model, which uses the idea that a call option can represent a company's equity to assess its risk. The maximization of expected lifetime utility with respect to the allocation of wealth between equity and risk-free assets is known as the namesake portfolio problem of this economist. This member of the failed LTCM hedge fund may be better remembered for enhancing the option-pricing model developed by two of his colleagues.

Dan Sperber and Deirdre Wilson wrote a book named after one of this thinker's constructions, claiming it subsumed the three similar constructs with which it was grouped. According to this thinker, certain attempts at communication tend to be non-conventional, calculable, non-detachable, and defeasible. This thinker described exploitation of his constructs through flouting them as a form of communication. This man defined a speaker trying to impart something to a hearer merely by having the hearer recognize his intention as non-natural meaning, or meaning-nn. His theory of implicatures espouses that people pay attention to Quality, Quantity, Relevance, and Manner in making cooperative utterances.

By using a mathematical model in which valuation varied with quality, Novos and Waldman concluded that this concept did not lead to increased social loss from underutilization, while Takeyama showed that under certain conditions the absence of this concept could produce Pareto optimal results via network effects. David Levine and Michelle Boldrin have argued against this concept in a book which claims that this concept does not produce the increasing returns claimed by its advocates. The decision in Feist v. Rural established that "sweat of the brow," was not sufficient for this status, holding that this status requires originality. Baker v. Selden held that this status was not applicable to an idea but only to the expression of an idea itself, while Gyles v. Wilcox established an abridgement of this status called "fair use."

In a recent paper, Robert Griffiths of CMU has argued that this property is identical to the factorization condition used in deriving the CHSH theorem, and has claimed that it is always present so long as the probabilities are evaluated on the proper sample spaces. In the formalism of Ghirardi, Rimini, and Weber, the absence of this property is equivalent to the occurrence of outcome-dependence. The absence of this property is explicitly assumed in the velocity guiding equation that is central to the Bohm formalism.

Derrida argues that if this practice is truly the "necessity of borrowing one's concepts from the texts of a heritage...it must be said that all discourse" could be partaking of this process. The formulator of this concept presented it in a work which analyzed the marriage rituals of the Aranda and the Arabanna, two indigenous Australian groups.

Problems related to this arise in the econometrics of strategic interaction since there is not a mapping from observable outcomes to underlying parameters unless some identifying assumption is used. This is a feature of Diamond and Dybvig's model of bank runs since patient depositors may or may not withdraw their deposits in period one. So Morris and Shin offer a modification in which depositors observe the period two return with noise, in which case the equilibrium is in cutoff strategies. Thomas Schelling's notion of the 'focal point' is a means to predict which outcome of games with this property will be observed. Schelling's famous example is that "noon at Grand Central" would be chosen by any two individuals looking to meet in New York City.

Unlike Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, Kripke-Platek set theory does not have the axiom of infinity or the one named for this object, although it is still possible to prove the existence of Cartesian products in Kripke-Platek set theory, which is usually done in Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory by using the axiom which constructs this object. In automata theory, constructing an equivalent deterministic finite automaton from a given nondeterministic finite automaton with set of states Q involves performing this operation on Q and using the result as the new set of states for the deterministic finite automaton. Cantor's diagonalization argument can be generalized to show that the cardinality of this object is strictly greater than the cardinality of the object it is constructed from.

In Drautzburg and Uhlig's model of this, the length of time that the Zero Lower Bound is binding is a critical determinant of the effectiveness of this tool, and those authors conclude that the multiplier associated with this is less than one. Barro argued that this tool can never be effective since a government that sells its debt to its own citizens, to be repaid by taxing them or their children, cannot add to the overall wealth in the economy. That argument is ostensibly drawn from David Ricardo, though he himself doubted its empirical validity. This tool was most famously advocated by Keynes as a means to smooth fluctuations in aggregate demand.

Four sets of equations, including two that describe the function of individual households, comprise the model named for this man and Cassel. This man theorized that in perfect competition, profits would approximate zero, because prices would approximate costs. Each agent calculates his demand for the good at every possible price and submits this to an auctioneer in the auction named for this man. The law named for this man suggests that if all other markets in a system are in equilibrium, the remaining market must also be in equilibrium; that observation underpins his most famous theory, which was improved upon by Arrow and Debreu.

Tobin and Mundell showed that real economic effects can occur from expectation of this phenomenon, which can lead to inefficiencies from shoe-leather and menu costs. The existence of this phenomenon prevents a "liquidity trap."

The final chapter of this book discusses an "abnormal form" of the title concept in which poor regulation prompts a decrease in "functional activity." Its seventh chapter largely refutes Spencer's theory of contracts, stating that positive control is on the rise due to the fundamentally restitutive nature of modern laws. This work contrasts such restitutive systems with the typically repressive systems of primitive peoples, where common experiences prompt a mechanical solidarity that is fundamentally different from the organic solidarity of modern society. Organic solidarity is then said to derive from the title concept, which increases productivity yet leads to the alienation of the individual as well as anomie.

The Supreme Court declined to extend this case to contractual abdication of one's right to free speech in United Egg Producers v. Standard Brands, and an Ohio court notably refused to apply this case to the probation of a will in Shapira v. Union National Bank, in which the decedent conditioned his sons' inheritance on their marrying Jewish women.

Another work discussing this concept opens a section about an "ethnographic theory" of it by examining "the meaning of meaningless words" and later looks at coefficients of intelligibility. That work recounts how Bagido'u inherited authority over a system of towosi called Kaylu'ebila that exists in Omarakana and discusses the formulae related to this concept in its last part.

Walter Benjamin claimed that this part of a larger work appears at such a significant moment that it looks as though the novel in which it is contained is only the unfolding of this story. This fragment of a larger work is followed by an interpretive monologue that considers such aspects as the "impersonal questions," and the "Tatar beard," of one individual in this story, and the man who tells it later remarks that "the man sits down on the stool... and waits there for the rest of his life... of his own free will." This story, which is contained in a chapter entitled "In the Cathedral," concerns a man who seeks admission to something that he thinks "should be accessible to every man and at all times," but is denied entrance by a door-keeper, who, upon the man's death, shuts the door.

Modern views of this man's work are heavily influenced by Edwin Boring's "history" of the discipline that he founded. He believed that sentences were manifestations of the "whole mental processes" of individuals. One of his publications categorized feelings tri-dimensionally, depending on whether they were pleasant or unpleasant, excited or depressed, and tense or relaxed. His historical theory classified man into primitive, totemic, heroic, and present ages. His analysis focused on the process of (*) "apperception," the study of which defined this man's introspective method. This thinker's student called his approach "Ganzheit" or "holistic."

This thinker studied women's dress fashions and found that no external causes determined their style. In his studies of the Anapaho and Medieval Europe, this person postulated that while environmental conditions limited subsistence patterns, they did not determine cultural output. This man claimed that geniuses arose from certain cultural conditions in his book Configurations of Culture Growth. This man borrowed a term from Herbert Spencer to describe his vision of culture as a being of its own, irreducible to individuals. In addition to writing about the (*) "superorganic" while at Berkeley, this anthropologist learned about the Yana tribe from a subject who his wife Theodora wrote a book about "in two worlds."

One writer claimed that this concept is an "experience of [the] limits" of nature in an essay that distinguishes this concept from the marvelous and events not controlled by natural laws. This concept was first introduced in a work that claims that bright children are more fearful since they are aware of the limits of their knowledge and also argues this phenomenon arises from "intellectual uncertainty" about one's usual environment. It was described in Tzvetan Todorov's "The Fantastic" and in an essay by Ernst Jentsch, the latter of which formed the basis of another essay about this concept that claims that the fear of blinding in E.T.A. Hoffman's "The Sandman" represented a fear of (*) castration. That essay claims that this concept is the return of repressed infantile fears and traces the linguistic origins of this concept from the German word for "unhomely". This concept is also explained as the unease when confronted with a look-alike or a severed hand.

A commodity-indexed form of this quantity is multiplied by factor productivity to obtain the "single factorial" form of this quantity, and was developed by Jacob Viner. According the Herberger-Laursen-Metzler hypothesis, a decrease in this quantity directly leads to a decrease in savings rate. Singer and Prebisch invoked low income-elasticity of demand to hypothesize that in the long run, this quantity declines for primary products and natural resources, prompting many countries to adopt (*) ISI policies. A "small open economy" is one which is unable to shift this quantity even with changes in its offer curve, and in the 2-factor, 2-country, 2-goods neoclassical framework, it is calculated as the slope of the line connecting the origin to the intersection of offer curves.

This thinker claimed that the fact that Hobbes and Foucault both spoke of a "war of all against all" leads many to think that they have more in common besides "the fact that, with the exception of Hobbes, both were bald." One of his texts arose from a debate with Gananath Obeyesekere about the distinction between "Western" and "indigenous" thought, which arose from Obeyesekere's book about a certain figure who was mistaken for Lono. He relied on Richard B. Lee's studies among the !Kung (pronounced "[tongue-click] Kung") for a symposium about "Man the Hunter" at which he proposed one of his notable theses, which was later expounded on in his Stone Age Economics.

One work by this man was adapted from a lecture on the genetic, intellectual, and subconscious origins of human values and was heavily edited by William Warren Bartley. That work argues against the possibility of constructing any society one wishes and claims that people prefer visible change to the unseen order of capitalism. This man examined different aspects of the welfare state in a work that defined freedom as the "absence of coercion" and incorporated parts of the unfinished work "The Creative Powers of a Free Civilization". An addendum to that work by this author of The (*) Fatal Conceit rejects the title belief since it wants to "stand still" and its distrust of "new and strange" ideas embraced by liberals. In his most famous work, this man claimed that the existence of a free society depends on the presence of an "impersonal forces" of the unregulated capitalist market.

Every one-percent increase in this quantity corresponds to a two-percent loss in potential GDP in the "gap version" of Okun's law. Keynes's attacks of Pigou's work about a "theory" of it led Pigou to formulate the "real balance effect" whereby a rise in this quantity leads to a drop in prices, which eventually results in this quantity becoming zero. Phelps theorized that in the long run, it can be represented by a vertical line called the NAIRU. As inflation increases, this quantity decreases, according to the Phillips Curve.

The NAIRU model for this phenomenon is advocated by Milton Friedman and proposes a baseline for it. Edmund Phelps's investigations into it yielded an expectations-augmented form of one model of it. Causes of this include sectoral shift, which has frictional and structural forms.

One type of this procedure is a triply-eponymous method that counts how many times somebody from a stronger sample beats somebody from a weaker sample, quantified as capital U. In addition to the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney type, the Wald type of this procedure determines whether or not a parameter exists, and the Yates type corrects the Pearson chi-square type, which, like the type that uses the Student's t-distribution, requires finding the degrees of freedom to calculate the p-value necessary to reject the null hypothesis. Give the name common to these procedures which determine whether or not a result is statistically significant.

Ortony, Clore, and Collins developed a computational model of these phenomena. Rosalind Picard is a leading proponent of programming computers to recognize these phenomena. According to Solomon and Corbit's opponent-process theory, these phenomena disrupt homeostasis and are inversely proportional to their opposites. Robert Plutchik constructed a "wheel" of these entities and argued that they evolved biologically, in contrast to Carroll Izard, who thought they were hardwired into humans and identified ten major ones. Based on his studies of the Fore tribesmen, Paul Ekman argued for six universal ones. According to the Cannon-Bard model, these phenomena precede physiological reactions.

Commentary discussions of their authority alternates between two terms: she-niztavvu and she-kibbelu aleihem. Maimondes claims that only divine authority and revelation to Moses constitutes the proper basis for acceptance of these. It is argued that the principle of "dina demalkhuta dina" only applies within the context of their framework and thus Jewish marital law is outside its jurisdiction. The Tosefta claims four possible additions to these, including the magical practices described in Deuteronomy 18, while the tannaitic sources indicate a complete lack of agreement to their proper enumeration. He who accepts its obligations is referred to as ger-toshav or "resident-stranger," and only one of these derives exegetical support from outside Genesis 2:16. That one places an injunction on the eating of flesh of live animals, and the only positively formulated one establishes a requirement to have just Laws.

In one experiment, Leonard Berkowtiz gave electric shocks or praise to different subjects to develop a theory about how this state is caused by cues. A theory of scapegoating proposed by Dollard and Miller tries to explain why this state occurs in conjunction with frustration. Catharsis theory argues that humans purge this state through consumption of media, though that theory is completely contradicted by social learning theory applied to it. An evolutionary basis for this phenomenon is examined in a book by (*) Konrad Lorenz. An experiment that induced this state in children featured confederates who said "Sock him down" while hitting a Bobo Doll.

Franklin Fisher introduced so-called folk theorems to model this situation. The Lerner index for agents in this situation is given by "negative one divided by n times e," where e is an agent's demand curve. Most models of this situation differ in the assumption whether prices or quantities are set simultaneously. This situation features an intersection of the residual demand curve and the normal demand curve, such that demand curves are (*) discontinuous, or kinked. Finding Nash equilibria for this model can be done via the Bertrand, Cournot and Stackelberg models when n=2.

In the Marshall-Lerner condition, the sum of two applications of this quantity to exports and imports must exceed one. The Singer-Prebsich thesis argues that the value of this measurement when applied to manufactured goods suggests that commodity-rich nations will become increasingly impoverished. Values for this concept can be found by taking a linear regression when both variables are expressed in natural logarithms. If the demand function is known, Lerner's Mark-up Rule applies this concept to solve for the optimal price of a good. Veblen and Giffen goods have a positive value for the price version of this. Today, economists use this concept to understand how a tax burden is distributed between the producer and consumer.

Formally, a preference relation has this property if it is transitive and complete, and the Allais Paradox pertains to the absence of this property in experimental settings. A seminal 1961 paper argues that expectations of price movements are predictions under the relevant economic theory, and hence those expectations possess this property.

This work slanders its primary target as promulgator of a new "iron law of wages", and marked a major rejection of the political pragmatism espoused by the author's disciples Wilhelm Liebknecht and August Bebel. This work opens by disputing that "labor is the source of all wealth" and proceeds to semantically dismember a series of proclamations the author deems to be infected by the evils of Ferdinand Lassalle.

One result of this economic formalism is that, regardless of starting point, the dynamics will converge to a balanced path, and a consequence of this formalism is that a change in the savings rate only has a level effect. A critical assumption of this formalism is that the production function has constant returns to scale, and this model gives rise to a first-order (*) differential equation in which the rate of change of the capital stock per unit of effective labor is equal to the difference between actual and break-even investment.

Christina Hoff Summers has criticized this work for failing to make the data available. The author cites Matina Horner's work on the Thematic Aperception Test to criticize McClleland's categories of "hope success" and "fear success".  Based on developmental theories in "The Reproduction of Mothering", the author borrows from Nancy Chodorow the idea that roles are imprinted early in life. The author writes that the work is grounded in listening, and the discussion of the Heinz dilemma centers around Julia's need to resolve a network of relationships rather than considering individual rights. Thus, the work criticized the three stages of development by positing an "ethics of care" that women were predisposed to. FTP, identify this work which provided a feminist counterpoint to Kohlberg's moral stages, written by Carol Gilligan.

Darwin was the first to theorize about them, defining them as a motor concept.  Fishbein and Ajzen developed a theory to explain their effect on action, while Sherif's social judgment theory posited a "lattitude of acceptance" to explain how they change.  In 1934 LaPiere demonstrated their lack of predictive power in a study of hotel manager's willingness to serve Chinese guests. Bem's self perception theory posits that they are formed by observing one's own behavior, while cognitive dissonance theory posits that they change when we perform behavior inconsistent with them.

Australian economist P. J. Lloyd has  argued that the basis of this idea can be found in the work The Isolated State, while John Stuart Mill explained his theory of comparative advantage using a system of equations that imply it . When applied to utility, it implies that all own price elasticities are negative one and all cross price elasticities are zero. Employing this model over small farms shows that nonessential factors may yield a positive product. One problem with this model is that applying statistical data to it sometimes suggests that the demand for labor is greater than 1. First proposed by Knut Wicksell, it implies constant returns to scale, and its namesakes also estimated that the share of labor and capital stays constant over time. For 10 points, identify this model which includes parameters for output elasticity as a function of technology, a doubly eponymous production function.

This work argues that the idea of classification is something that was inspired by natural division within human society rather than a priori. The titular concept was viewed as a "primordial matrix" from which other cultural elements emerged and since its author had no direct contact with the groups under investigation, much of its empirical evidence came from Spencer and Gillen's The Native Tribes of Central Australia. It expanded upon its author's notion of a "collective consciousness" encompassing a system of beliefs referred to as "collective representations," which included a cosmology or worldview. Society was divided it the sacred and profane, while the belief that social groups descend from a common animal or plant, totemism, was posited as a basic category.

Tyler Cowen cited a study by Lakner and Milanovic to argue that this quantity has decreased overall globally in the last 20 years. One economist credits a predicted increase in this statistic over time to his large estimates for elasticity of capital-labor substitution. This statistic is the y-axis of a graph showing a Kuznets curve, along which it initially increases, then decreases as per capita incomes rise with development.

Marshall criticizes Ricardo's theory of this concept in the Introduction to Book 3 of his Principles of Economics. One form of this concept can be found by subtracting the substitution and income effects from its Marshallian form. That "correspondence", named for John Hicks, is often used because it doesn't require the use of variables to represent income or wealth.

Kyle Herkenhoff proposed that the increasing availability of this concept partly explains the rise of unemployment duration since the late 1970s, and the contemporaneous skewing of the wealth distribution, since the unemployed can forego unsuitable job offers. Mian and Sufi's research shows that zip codes in which house prices dropped the most during the financial crisis exhibited the largest drop in demand for non-tradeable services thanks to the buildup of this quantity, which titles their book. The most productive agents are also the least patient ones in Kiyotaki and Moore's endogenous business cycle model, which imposes a collateral requirement to limit this quantity. In that model, a negative shock to the market value of collateral provokes insolvency, which brings about a Fisherian deflation driven by this quantity. The accumulation of this quantity is the driving force in Hyman Minsky's financial instability hypothesis. For 10 points, what is this quantity, which goes up the more spending exceeds income?

Claire Jean Kim proposed a "triangle" named for this concept which argues that a certain group of people have "relative valorization" over others. In an essay about "the aporias of a modern concept," Etienne Balibar argued that anthropology is in a state of "decomposition" since philosophy and sociology are more suited to investigate this concept. A book about this concept argues that those negatively affected by it are subject to neither exploitation nor oppression, but rather, the "nihilistic threat," which is the loss of hope and meaning. In The Mind of Primitive Man, Franz Boas concluded that this concept has no impact on cultural development or intelligence.

With Melville Herskovits and Ralph Linton, Robert Redfield issued a memorandum for the study of this process in 1936. As part of a study at UCLA in 1978, John Schumann created a model by this name to describe second language acquisition. Canadian psychologist John Berry created perhaps the best-known model ofthis process, which places people into four boxes - that model built on the work of Theodore Graves, who coined the term for the "psychological" type of this process. This term itself was first used in 1880 by John Wesley Powell in his report to the U.S. Bureau of American Ethnography.

The Rorschach, TAT and MAPS exams were given to thirty people with this quality by Evelyn Hooker, who found no linkage between it and intelligence. Irving Beiber conducted a 1962 study of 106 men with this condition, which he noted manifested as personality defects.

This statement was first proposed to explain Simon Kuznets' data showing no change in the savings rate since 1899 even as the savings rates across earnings percentiles differed. This idea is usually paired with Franco Modigliani's life-cycle hypothesis, and it was developed as a critique of John Maynard Keynes' concept of a consumption function.

When a creditor has the right to have his lien satisfied from a particular piece of property without having possession of that property, his lien is referred to by this adjective. The doctrine of laches and the doctrine of unclean hands are these types of defenses, which deny relief to a plaintiff that has acted in bad faith. In contract law, these remedies include rescission, reformation, and specific performance.

A data set of all examples of it since 1945 was gathered for a game-theoretic paper on its "Breakdown" by Barbara Geddes. A study with its adjective form in its title often contrasts college students dubbed "Mack" and "Larry;" that study's authors included Else Frankel-Brunswik, Nevitt Sanford, and Daniel Levinson. According to a 2012 book by Milan Svolik, the resolution of two "fundamental" problems underpins the Politics of this sort of (*) Rule. " Karen Stenner relates its prevalence to "perceived threat." Anti-intraception, projectivity, and exaggerated concern about sex are among nine factors in the psychology conducive to it, according to a 1950 study which introduced the "F-scale" test.

Olivier Blanchard and Nobuhiro Kiyotaki showed this feature alone could not explain how aggregate demand affects output. A 1977 model of this scenario includes a utility function with a parameter p that controls the preference for diversity.

Susan Athey and Guido Imbens generalized this technique to scenarios where groups can respond to differently to the same policy. Marianne Bertrand and others examined studies that used it and found OLS estimates of the standard errors were misleadingly precise when serial correlation was an issue. It can be treated as fixed-effects estimation with aggregate data. A common problem with this technique is with bias that results from participation being based on outcomes prior to the intervention, a phenomenon known as the Ashenfelter dip. (*) Studies using it frequently rely on laws changing in some states but not others, and then comparing the change in the trends to estimate the effect of the treatment free of state- or time-omitted variable bias.

Terry Bouton argues that the rate of this action eclipsed 37ty percent for many Pennsylvania counties in the decade a7ter the Revolutionary War, pursuant to a deliberate state-building project. Congress introduced a 5-year waiting period as a prerequisite to certain instances of this action in the Frazier-Lemke Act. The story of a cancer nurse, a car dealership worker, and an insurance fraud specialist uncovering fraudulent instances of this action is told in a 2016 David Dayen book. Merle Hansen led an organization that resisted this action during the Great Depression by intimidating people during "penny auctions." Critics claim that organizations like MERS have facilitated this action on an industrial scale with the practice of "robo-signing." Residents evicted from the Umoja Village shantytown in Miami took advantage of Florida's crippling high rate for this action during a 2010 crisis, whose fallout forced Bank of America and others to put a freeze on many instances of this action.

The presence of co-ops is shown to increase the rate of technological innovations in these markets in agricultural industries, and one behavior in this situation states that the minor firms will follow the lead of another firm's decisions on quantity in the Stackelberg model. Simultaneous determination of prices occurs in the Bertrand model for them, which suggests that firms may use marginal-cost pricing, while firms simultaneously determine output in the Cournot model for these markets.

The last chapter of this work is concerned with discovering the "optimal mix" of its title concepts, and concludes that no such mix can be found that would be stable over time. This work's first chapter draws on previous studies by Cyert and March to argue that "slack... is continuously being generated as a result of some sort of entropy characteristic of human... societies." In a chapter dedicated to the dynamics of two-party systems, this work notes that the Goldwater nomination falsified the Hotelling-Downs thesis, and its fifth chapter points to a "too-little noticed type of monopoly-tyranny: an oppression of the weak by the incompetent." The seventh chapter of this work puts forth a theory of its third title concept, which this work argues inhibits the application of the first title concept. This work argues that economists, such as Milton Friedman with his voucher plan, have overestimated the influence of its first title concept and underestimated that of the second, while political scientists have made the reverse error.

This article was criticized by Peter Bernholz by claiming that because the problem it was addressing was a constitutional question, and because that problem cannot be solved without comparing the costs of    different decision rules, this article's assumption of unrestricted domain was unjustified. In a 1996 article, James Buchanan argued that the main rule outlined in this article was self-contradictory, and criticized this article's author for not addressing the assignment or the starting-point problem, claiming that its results "seem more significant than they are because of the fundamental confusion between the evaluation of complete social states and the evaluation of elements within these states." This article, which was extended by its author in a later work titled "Liberty, Unanimity, and Rights," uses a thought experiment involving the preferences of two different people regarding the reading of Lady Chatelier's Lover to illustrate its central point about the incompatibility of the U, P, and L conditions.

In another work, this thinker argued that the Tiller Girls represent a change in the "body culture," and constitute a "linear system" which no longer has any "erotic meaning, but at best points to the locus of the erotic." In addition to the collection which contains those essays, and which shares its name with the latter, titled The Mass Ornament, this thinker argued that the title work of art spawned depictions of both tyrants and "mute chaos," and traced the history of a certain art form "from Caligari to Hitler." This thinker's magnum opus offered what he called a "material aesthetics" of the title art for, and operated on the assumption that this form was "essentially an extension of photography," and "come[s] into its own when [it] record[s] and reveal[s] physical reality."

A book by Clark Hull proposes that data from these things be arranged in "expectancy tables" and fed into a "prediction machine." In a 1915 article, Walter Dill Scott advocated for the usage of these things in the hiring process, so that both the "physical condition" and "native ability" of applicants can be ascertained. Many of these things, such as the Morrisby Profile, and the "Differential" one developed at Chicago, make the "Single-Classification Battery Assumption." Robert Yerkes created two of these things, dubbed "Alpha" and (*) "Beta," to distinguish "fluid" and "crystallized" forms of a certain concept.

Words that illustrate this concept are classified according to their "dryness," "wetness," "lightness," or "darkness" in a 1926 paper by Harold Conklin examining the Hanunoo language. A controversial Winawer et al. study found that English speakers were slower than Russian speakers in differentiating two similar varieties of this concept. A 1969 book that formulated a seven-stage hierarchy by which languages develop words for this concept was authored by Brent Berlin and Paul Kay. The development of words for this concept is explored in Guy Deutscher's (*) Through the Language Glass.

In surveying army officers, he found that they rated their soldiers based on holistic perceptions of good and bad, which came to be known as the Halo effect. He may better be known for incorporating maxims concerning readiness and exercise into a theory based on findings that random behaviors were used to try to lift a (*) latch, but only those immediately preceding the latch opening would be repeated.

Michael Lindsay, in his Beast in Sheep's Clothing, criticized this work as an "arcane" attempt by the author to discredit the title character, the one man who reminded him of his guilty conscience. The author of this work readily admitted to deriving its premise from the work of Ernst Sellin, and this work argued against Rank's belief that heroes born of a great family are raised in a lesser family, noting that the titular figure's name comes from an Egyptian word for "child." The author draws an analogy between a group's historic trauma, defense, latency, and neuroses to those of an individual, and that a certain violent (*) deed brought about reaction formation in a group of people causing them to reconsider their faith.

A concept first proposed by this economist and elaborated by Kiyotaki and Moore explains how credit market imperfections lead to sudden, asymmetrical declines in asset prices.

That process of "debt deflation" was posited by this economist after he lost all of his wealth in the 1929 stock market crash.

The silhouetted image of an Abu Ghraib prisoner was used as the cover art of a controversial Jon Pahl book about the relationship between this concept and the Origins of American Violence. One thinker argued that this concept evolves and gradually grows more differentiated over five stages, beginning with the Primitive stage and ending with the Modern stage. That thinker coined the term for a variety of this concept in a 1967 essay that splits a country's history into three "times of crisis." Arlington National Cemetery, Memorial Day, and (*) John F.

This psychologist worked closely with Eugene Gendlin to develop his "focusing" approach, a method by which one acquires inner awareness by identifying a "felt sense." This psychologist emphasized "experiential" over "rote" learning and included "realness" and "prizing" among the healthy attitudes needed for a good facilitator of learning. This author of Freedom to Learn formulated the notion of "encounter groups." This thinker laid out the principles of his primary framework in a set of (*) nineteen propositions. This psychologist defined "incongruity" as the gap between one's ideal self and one's real self, which is realized through a self-actualizing tendency.

.   The cognitive-affective processing model posits that this ability is correlated positively with using "cool" cognitive strategies instead of "hot" cognitive strategies. Failure to perform this psychological, non-economic ability can be modeled formally using hyperbolic utility functions that demonstrate an individual's dynamic inconsistency. Failure to perform this ability correlates with high ventral striatum activity, and this ability is directly opposed by (*) temporal discounting. This ability was discovered to be correlated with higher SAT scores by Walter Mischel, who studied this ability in an experiment in which subjects were left in a room with the namesake object. Many of those subjects would bang on the table or squirm as they struggled to contain themselves to obtain a second of the namesake snack. This capacity was tested for in the Stanford marshmallow experiment. For 10 points, identify this ability to resist immediate reward in favor of waiting for a later reward.

According to a hypothesis proposed in On the Nature of Grammatical Relations by Alec Marantz, this concept is found in the D-structure level in Government and Binding Theory. Based in large part on the work done by Uhlenbeck, this concept has been theorized to have originally been the basis for Proto-Indo-European, based on the suppletion in certain pronouns and based on a discrepancy between animate and inanimate nouns. Several Australian languages show a split, using this system for nouns, but a competing one for pronouns. In English, this property is found in a certain class of verbs concerned with statal changes, such as the verb "break", in which the agency of the subject, or lack thereof, reflects the transitivity of the verb.

A book by a thinker from this country was re-assessed in a 1968 lecture by Stanley Tambiah, who claimed that the title phenomenon functions as a metaphor to achieve "operational reality," rather than the subject of actual belief. A different thinker from this country criticized the work of E.P. Thompson in the essay "My Correct Views on Everything," and wrote a work of intellectual history with sections titled "The Founders," "The Golden Age," and "The Breakdown." The "Bohemian," "Philistine," and "Creative-type" modes of acculturation were introduced in a five-volume study of emigrants from this country that was co- authored by W. I. (*) Thomas. A thinker from this country has repeatedly characterized the uncertainty of the present life course with the adjective "liquid."

 Recognition of these tangible things was famously tested among the Fore people using the POFA set. Joseph C. Hager helped develop a taxonomy of these things, their namesake "coding system." Maureen O'Sullivan was part of the "Wizards Project," which sought to identify people who are particularly good at gaining information from these tangible things. Wallace Friesen coauthored several studies that attempted to debunk the cultural specificity of these tangible things. A book on the "Mechanism" of these things was based on experiments that demonstrated their physical basis by using (*) electrical probes. Photographs of Duchenne de Boulogne's work with these things inspired Charles Darwin's last major book. Six of these tangible things are "universally recognized," according to Paul Ekman, as manifesting anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise.

This adjective is the first word of a process which functions to naturalize social asymmetries between men and women, as put forth in the book Masculine Domination. A theoretical perspective titled partially by this adjective influenced the use of (*) "breaching experiments" in the ethnomethodology of Harold Garfinkel.

A 1986 paper by Brander and Lewis pointed to the existence of a "limited liability effect" on financial structuring decisions within these systems. The categories of "strategic complements" and "strategic substitutes" were introduced in a 1985 paper about these systems by Bulow, Geanakoplos, and Klemperer. A 1964 article by George Stigler argues that variability of sales determines the level of cheating in these systems, and concludes that these systems don't need to be analyzed as separate cases. To solve a model of these systems, one uses backward induction to find the best response function of the (*) follower and then finds the point on that function that maximizes the payoff for the leader. That model of competition in these systems was developed by Heinrich von Stackelberg, and is similar to one developed by Cournot.

One author argued that these things fail due to the deterioration of "creative minorities," and categorized four of them as "abortive" and five as "arrested." A more recent article about these things borrows H. D. Greenway's notion of the (*) "kin-country" syndrome to describe examples of "rallying" within them.

In Gaelic languages, this general term is sometimes used in place of the more specific eclipsis, which is contrasted with the Gaelic-specific process of lenition. Around a hundred years ago, native languages around Puget Sound began changing so that sounds with this property became voiced stops. The Slavic languages include many examples of pre-stopped versions of sounds with this property. In Guaran, this property is extended in both directions when a stressed syllable exhibits it in a notable example of this propertys harmony. As a general rule, English vowels acquire this property when they precede consonants possessing it within the same syllable, as in the first syllable of the word finger. Many French vowels and the English consonants M and N possess, for 10 points, what phonetic property produced when speakers lower their soft palate and block most of the mouth, allowing air to escape through their nose?

This metaphor appears in the title of a James Barker book that uses the case study of ISE Communications to examine a shift to concertive control from the method that this metaphor describes. A 1983 paper titled for this metaphor revisited by Paul DiMaggio and Walter Powell proposes coercive, mimetic, and normative isomorphic processes to explain why so many organizations are structured similarly. This metaphor was originally invoked as the updated version of the English Puritan Richard Baxters image of a light cloak that can be thrown aside at any moment and represents the care for external goods. Talcott Parsonss translation provides the more familiar two-word formulation of this metaphor, although more recent scholars sometimes render the original German stahlhartes Gehuse using the word shell.

Paul Romer criticized this theory for relying on unexplained variables, which he mockingly named aether, phlogiston, a gremlin, and a troll. The classic paper introducing this paradigm assumes a four-quarter time-to-build for creation of fixed capital, and concludes that supply-side shocks like oil price hikes, rather than demand-side shocks, cause booms and recessions.

Steven Olley and Ariel Pakes developed a technique that accounts for simultaneity and selection bias when estimating parameters of these entities. Franklin Fisher criticized the stringent assumptions necessary for the micro version of these mathematical entities to aggregate to a macro one. The translog example of these objects is commonly used in estimation because it is linear in parameters and is an approximation of the CES type. A 2014 paper by Loukas Karabarbounis and Brent Neiman estimates one of their parameters to be about 1.25 and uses that fact to link falling investment prices to the declining labor share. The Inada conditions impose restrictions on the partial derivatives of these entities. A residual from estimating them is called technical productivity or total factor productivity.

An essay by Maurice Bloch contrasts two types of this concept, a socially constructed type used for rituals and a universal type used for everyday life. A 1978 book argues that anthropological fieldwork has been plagued by the schizogenic use of this concept because of the denial of coevalness, which causes researchers to distinguish one type of this concept for themselves and another for the subjects they study. Clifford Geertz cited ceremonies with an absence of climax and a depersonalizing conception of personhood to argue that this concept is immobilized in Bali.

A media studies theory named in part for this response includes the notion that the four uses of media are diversion, personal relationships, personal identity, and surveillance; that theory is named for uses and this reaction. In fMRI studies of the ability to control this reaction by B.J.Casey, images of happy, neutral, and afraid faces were displayed; Casey revealed that the ability to control this emotion is tied to activation of the anterior prefrontal cortex, as opposed to the ventral striatum. A study of this response performed at the Bing Nursery School found that it was significantly correlated to life outcomes; in that study, Ebbe Ebbesen and Walter Mischel (VALL-tuh MISH-ull) offered a choice between one marshmallow now or two marshmallows later.

Speakers of this language separate verbs into two units, one indicating the sort of action and the other indicating direction, and organize those units in an A-B-A pattern to indicate continuous action. An experiment that can be seen as supporting the SapirWhorf hypothesis had speakers of an early form of this language attempt to find objects that had been hidden as they watched; speakers of this language performed markedly worse than other children their age, which may be because they didnt yet have words for left or right. In this languages early history, its speakers alternately used rotated and mirrored representations of actions, but converged on rotated as it developed. This language was first studied by Judy Kegl.

Assar Lindbeck claimed that, aside from bombing, these policies were the most efficient technique for destroying cities. These policies are largely enforced due to an official housing emergency in a city where over a million units are covered by forms of this policy.

Melanie Klein discussed a form of this concept as an instinct of curiosity that is oriented towards knowledge. Rene Girard theorized that the origin of human conflict is in the mimetic form of this concept, which is born from resentment. Deleuze and Guattari argued that this concept is constituted by excess instead of lack, and often described subjects as machines which enact this concept. In the Four Fundamental Concepts, Jacques Lacan wrote that the Other gave this concept to the subject and denoted the object-cause of this phenomenon with a petit a (peh-TEE AH).
