In the mass continuity equation ";the partial time derivative of theta equals the negative of the partial derivative of z times q,"; this equation is plugged into q to derive the Richards equation.

Shapiro and Teukolsky have explained a possible violation of this principle by simulating sufficiently large collisionless gas spheroids by seemingly observing the effects of the hoop conjecture.

The main issue underlying this property was first pointed out by Dicke and Peebles, who suggested that an explanation is necessary to figure out why initial gravitational and kinetic energies were approximately equal, as that implies a zero-energy system.

For a sinusoidal input voltage with a given frequency, this type of circuit will also output a sinusoidal voltage of the given frequency.

In principal component analysis, the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix correspond to these quantities.

Mueller and Arnett proposed a stochastic self-propagating version of this process in order to explain flocculent structures, and the Butcher-Oemler effect implies that this process occurs more often in older objects because said objects are bluer.

The replacement of symmetric connections in this system with directed connections that form an acyclic graph is used to create a sigmoid belief network, which eliminates this system's requirement of a negative phase. This model employs symmetrically connected stochastic components which are partitioned into visible and hidden layers, with the visible layer clamped to specific environment-determined states. The goal of this type of neural network is to maximize a likelihood function, which it does by adjusting synaptic weights in proportion to the correlation between the states of its component neurons. Learning in these networks is accomplished via Gibbs sampling combined with a downward adjustment of the network "temperature," in a process called simulated annealing.

Hu and White worked out this process's namesake damping envelope, which interpolates between small and large angular scales as a function of optical depth and the horizon size. The effect of this process on the CMB power spectrum is to suppress it by a constant factor at small angular scales while leaving the larger angular scales unchanged. The presence of the Gunn-Peterson trough in quasar spectra determines the lower redshift bound for the occurrence of this process, after which the universe becomes transparent to photons. This process, lasting from redshift of about 11 to about 6.5, commenced with the formation of the first quasars and followed the so-called Dark Ages.

In one limiting factor for systems with this phenomenon, the term two over mu-sub-e, all squared, isusually approximated as unity. The Lane-Emden equation for systems with this phenomenon uses indicesof three-halves and three, in the non-relativistic and relativistic cases. The non-relativistic and relativisticequations of state for this phenomenon are polytropic relations proportional to the five-thirds andfour-thirds power of density, respectively. That limiting factor can be derived from the fact that systemswith this phenomenon have radius proportional to the negative one-third power of mass. It haltsgravitational contraction before the temperature can become sufficiently high for fusion in brown dwarfs,and Type Ia supernovae occur when it can no longer balance the gravitational force as the "famousChandrasekhar mass limit" is exceeded.

The reciprocal of the total of this quantity is equal to the sum of the reciprocals of the radiative and conductive versions of this quantity. The average version of this quantity is proportional to density times temperature to the negative seven-halves power according to Kramers Law. One method of calculating this relies on applying the diffusion approximation to the radiative transfer equation; that version is named for Rosseland. Changes in this quantity due to increases in temperature are the namesake and basis of the kappa mechanism driving pulsations in variable stars, and for sun-like stars, the source of this property is mostly the h-minus ion.

The BEMER Model based on this expression adds climactic parameters to it to account for geographically specific systems.

That namesake later worked with Brazilian scientist Mario Schonberg on a similar notion dealing with helium-filled cores. This idea results from viewing relevant stars as gases of non-interacting fermions and, when it is exceeded, electron degeneracy pressure can no longer overcome gravitational pressure.

One strategy for locating these objects uses Raychauduri's equation to search for convergence to a caustic in finite time.

The prevailing hypothesis of this event's mechanism is not supported by a 13% content of iron oxide and a dearth of siderophilic elements in the object that it produced.  Fans of science history will be sure to note that the first scientific theory of this event was proposed by Osmond Fisher and Charles Darwin's son George in 1879.  1963 and 1969 papers by Wise proposed the "fission" hypothesis of this event, which was supported by a 1974 A.B.

In weather forecasting, semi-Lagrangian models avoid this phenomenon by replacing advection terms with Lagrangian transport. One way to deal with this phenomenon in general is to set Fourier amplitudes larger than"two thirds" of the maximum range to 0. That technique is truncation, and is similar to the "three halves" rule or padding of wavenumbers. This phenomenon causes an excess of energy to be accumulated in short wavenumbers because the finite difference scheme cannot resolve wavelengths shorter than twice the mesh size according to the Nyquist theorem. Visually, the "temporal" form of this phenomenon leads to the "wagon-wheel effect." A simple example of this phenomenon is using a spacing interval of 1 when trying to reconstruct the sine function.

Stability against this process for a rotating star is given by the Ledoux Criterion, though if the density of stellar material is non-constant, the Solberg-Hoiland criterion is used instead since it adds a term dependent on the colatitude.

This entity's magnetic field standoff distance is only 1.6 times its own radius, making it so that it cannot support radiation belts. When a probe was deflected by this object, scientists determined that its density was 5,430 kilograms per cubic meter. Thus, scientists determined that42 percent of this object is composed of iron and that it is the most iron-rich object in the SolarSystem. The Arecibo satellite fired a pulse at this object and found that its rotational period was58.6 days, establishing that it has a 3:2 spin-orbit resonance. While studying this object, Urbain Le Verrier found that a value of 43 arc-seconds per tropical century characterizes the rate of precession of its perihelion.

Research by Daniel Kirk-Davidoff suggests that these structures, and not deep convective clouds, increased the temperature of the Earth during the Eocene Epoch by creating a positive feedback loop. These objects are typically formed during an austral winter when wind passes over mountain ranges and subsequently induces the formation of gravity waves. That in turn leads to the creation of these structure's ice crystals which have temperatures lower than 85 degrees Celsius. Their one-A, one-B, and one-C types are composed of metastable water and nitric or sulphuric acid. They form at latitudes above 50 degrees and are usually only visible during twilight.

A potentially more energy-efficient modification to this procedure, proposed by Hoelker and Silber, applies a change in energy during the third time an object intersects a line defined by the eccentricity vector.

In this period, subduction of the Kula and Farallon plates under the North American plate contributed to the Laramide orogeny. A series of large volcanic eruptions formed the Deccan Traps at the end of this period.

Measuring this quantity for water masers associated with galactic centers makes it possible to directly determine the distance to the galaxy.

Touchet beds, which consist of distinct rhythmite deposits with an approximately 55Â­year periodicity, are evidence for the existence of one of these features in the late Pleistocene. Geologist J.

The diffusion of water into materials made from this rock creates a narrow band with a width that grows like the square root of time and thus allows the age of such materials to be found in a namesake hydration dating. When in contact with groundwater, this rock will absorb the water which bleaches the rock white and expands it in size to create the mineral (*) perlite. Â Patches of crystals of cristobalite can form during cooling resulting in white blotches which give rise to the "snowflake" variety of this rock. The high silica content is derived from its formation from polymerized lava whose viscosity generally prevents any crystals from forming during cooling.

Velocity gradients present in these objects serve to create fine structure via a 'pinch instability' that occurs on a timescale equal to a thousand years times their optical depth times their size squared. A model explaining the densities of these structures utilizes perturbations from spiral density waves that cause regions of 'clumping' and was proposed by(*) Goldreich and Tremaine. An extremely large one of these was discovered in 2009 using the infrared Spitzer telescope and its believed to have formed from micrometeoric impacts on the moon, Phoebe. Conservation of angular momentum causes these structures to settle into the Laplace plane and their shape can be defined by gravitational interactions with bodies such as Amalthea or Pan and those bodies are called "shepherd moons".

In objects in which this property is very low, pair production in the core can reduce thermal pressure, thereby causing gravitational collapse and an explosion that does not leave a black hole in its wake. That process leads to a pair-instability supernova, which can only happen when this property is very low.

The biggest drawback of these filters is that their group delay has a huge peak compared to other IIR filters. The transfer function for these filters has a denominator of the form one plus epsilon squared 3 times the square of T-sub-N of big Omega, where T-sub-N is defined as the cosine of N times inverse cosine of Omega, for absolute value of Omega less than one, and hyperbolic cosine of N times inverse hyperbolic cosine of Omega for absolute value of Omega greater than one. These filters only have 6 poles, which lie in an ellipse in the complex plane. The even or oddness of their order determines whether unity or the reciprocal of one plus epsilon squared is where their (*) oscillations start. These filters achieve a fast roll-off by allowing equiripples in the passband Â– though, if said passband ripple is set to 9 0%, a maximally flat filter named for Butterworth is achieved.

This phenomenon forms the basis for the Suprime-Cam and VIRMOS-DESCART surveys, the latter of which found that the signal generated by this phenomenon has third-order non-Gaussianities. Van Waerbeke derived an upper bound of .4 for the matter density parameter and .7 as a lower bound for the amplitude of the dark matter power spectrum in the lambda-CDM model by assuming that this process causes large-scale structures to produce a coherent shear signal. In general, this phenomenon is best illustrated by collections of galaxies whose intrinsic ellipticies deviate from random-orientation.

George Dyson’s Turing’s Cathedral describes how a “two and two-thirds dimensional model” but not a “two and a half dimensional model” was able to catch this process by using data from Thanksgiving Day 1950. Reginald Sutcliffe and Sverre Petterssen found that this process occurs through a "bootstrapping" procedure that was eventually termed “self-development”. The formation of the most damaging localized surface winds, which is called a "sting", is ascribed to the formation of a "back-bent" structure in the Shapiro-Keyser model of this process. In Jule Charney's treatment, the formation of a large enough temperature gradient drives the spontaneous production of the Rossby Waves that then undergo this process. One of the oldest treatments of this process was proposed by the Bergen School of meteorologists; that treatment holds that this process involves the development of a structure in a barotropically cold environment. During this process, a cold front overtakes a warm front to create an occluded front. For 10 points, name this process of creating of circular storms.

The existence of this phenomenon is supported by the isotropic distribution of distant gamma-ray bursts and supernovae. One explanation for this phenomenon predicts adiabatic fluctuations and a lack of magnetic (*) monopoles. Saul Perlmutter, Adam Riess, and Brian Schmidt won the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics for establishing the acceleration of this phenomenon. Mathematically, it results from the cosmological constant, which may manifest itself as dark energy.

The ALFALFA sky survey at the Arecibo telescope in Puerto Rico and the THINGS survey at the Very Large Array in New Mexico both rely on this signal. Hendrik van de Hulst was the first to predict this signal, which was first observed by Ewen and Purcell. In 2018, a dip in the CMB corresponding to a redshifted absorption profile of this signal was announced by Judd Bowman’s group, who used the EDGES apparatus to discern the time of the birth of the first stars, or “cosmic dawn.” This signal is the primary tool for probing the cold neutral component of the interstellar medium. The most common way of plotting galactic rotation curves is to measure the Doppler shift in this radiation. This radiation is emitted when the spins of a single proton and single electron change from parallel to antiparallel.

The time required for this process to go from the most remote point in the area of interest to the outlet is called the “time of concentration.” The peak rate of this process is estimated by the so-called “rational method” that sets it equal to an empirical coefficient times the discharge area times the precipitation intensity. In a model by Robert E. Horton, the exponential decay of a different process over time during a storm causes this process to increase. The “infiltration excess” mechanism of this process occurs due to limitations on the infiltration rate, whereas the “saturation excess” mechanism occurs due to soil saturation.

Following this event, the mass-independent fractionation of sulfur isotopes was almost entirely replaced by mass-dependent fractionation. This event is attributed to cooling of the mantle and subsequent decrease in the availability of nickel-rich rock in the “nickel famine” theory. A spike in chromium rock deposits dating to this event suggests that a large increase in global levels of sulfuric acid occurred alongside it. This event likely caused the Huronian glaciation, which led to the first of many snowball Earths, as a result of the decrease in atmospheric methane.

In one form of this technique, a discontinuity can be created on a surface by introducing a barrier whose strength impacts the effective distance. It's not filtering, but this task can be accomplished by discrete convolution with the Lanczos (LAHN-chos) kernel. Using a collection within a defined search radius and introducing a direction factor were part of Donald Shepard's method for the multivariate form of this task, which improved upon inverse distance weighting. The Whittaker-Shannon formula allows for this technique to be accomplished using an infinite series of sinc functions. It's not smoothing, but this task can be accomplished using kriging or cubic splines. When performing this task on equispaced points, Runge's (roon-guh's) phenomenon becomes more prominent when employing higher order polynomials.

An object named for Duncan Lorimer is one of the fast, non-gamma ray, bursts, named for this regime. Later, the CHIME telescope would associate those bursts in this regime with magnetars. Ryle and Hewish received a Nobel prize for the development of a technique in this regime. That technique in this regime, aperture synthesis, was used to create an image of the center of M87 by the EHT. The Hanbury Brown and Twiss effect was first used in this regime to measure the diameter of Sirius via intensity interferometry. The Green Bank telescope exists in a national “quiet zone” for emission in this regime. The study of this regime was pioneered by a Bell Labs scientist's “Merry-go-round.” That scientist who studied this regime also names a non-SI unit of spectral flux density, the Jansky.

Moderator Note: Read answerline fully The Hudson Canyon lies in one of these things, which are often covered by relict sediments from the Ice Age. One of these named Campeche is an exception to the trend that active margins have smaller examples of them. Doggerland is on one of these things, while the Sunda one ends at Wallace’s Line. These entities are made of neritic and (*) benthic zones. These regions end at namesake “breaks,” after which there is a steeper “slope,” and they are often exposed with lower sea levels. For 10 points, name these submerged extensions of continent, the shallowest parts of the seabed.
