The beginning of this movement's coda presents eight bars of stretto near-inversions of the first theme between the low strings and violins; a different stretto between those instruments introduce this movement's third theme, which consists of three staccato notes followed by a trilled three-note figure. Elaine Sisman's monograph on the piece linked this movement with contemporary philosophical concepts of the sublime. In this movement, a theme consisting of a three-note dotted rhythm followed by a descending scale is the last presented in a passage of invertible counterpoint. For both this movement and a Missa brevis, the composer used a motif also found in the hymn (*) Lucis creator. This movement, which has tempo of Molto allegro and is in cut time, builds its first theme around the notes [read slowly] C-D-F-E and combines that theme with four other themes in the coda.

During a 2012 Diamond Jubilee concert, pianist Lang Lang added a prominent one of these things to a cadenza in Rhapsody in Blue. D sharp, F sharp, and A sharp are the first three of these things in a work whose Vivace first section precedes a Più lento B section that seemingly lacks them. Apocryphally, Charles Ives responded to comments that his Country Band March had “so many” of these things with the rejoinder “You’re quite right. It’s perfect.” Sergei Prokofiev described Stravinsky’s neoclassical works as “Bach on” these things. These things make the singer “doo doo doot” in a namesake “rag” that describes “a new sensation that’s goin’ around” from the musical Wonderful Town. These supposed things nickname the E-minor opus 25 No. 5 étude by Frederic Chopin, due to its rapidly-resolved 9ths and other dissonances.

Heinrich Schenker’s foreground graph of this musical work strangely omits the B natural in its 23rd bar, and is the second graph included in the Dover edition of his influential Five Graphic Music Analyses. In an intense chromatic moment in the eighth bar of this piece, the bass is suspended on the leading tone, creating a tonic major seventh chord, before resolving down to become the root of a minor 7th chord on scale degree 6. Arvo Pärt based portions of his 1968 choral-orchestral work Credo on this piece, which Rosalyn Tureck performed at a notoriously-slow circa 48 beats per minute on a 1953 recording. All but the last three bars of this piece follow a repeated three-voice notation pattern of—from bottom to top—a half note, a dotted eighth tied to a quarter, and six 16th notes.

In the third movement of George Crumb’s Echoes of Time and the River, this instrument spells out Crumb’s name in Morse code. It plays a repeated melodic fragment consisting of a leap down a minor ninth from B-flat to A, followed by G-sharp, A, leap up to B-flat, leap down to A, at the outset of an orchestral work derived from the ballet Cave of the Heart. Six bars into the “Polka” from Dmitri Shostakovich’s The Golden Age, this instrument introduces the movement's main melody. Flutes, oboes, clarinets, piano, strings, and this instrument begin rapid, constant 16th note figuration in the fourth bar of the overture to Porgy and Bess. It joins a clarinet, strings, and two pianos in a movement that quotes the folk songs “Ah!

Description acceptable. An art song about this event set a text that ends by noting “I'll put him myself / on one of your strong, flat boats / and we’ll sail together all the way / through evening.” An orchestral work whose third movement chaconne was based on taped recordings of piano and cello co-improvisations was inspired by this event; that work, which begins and ends with an open string A natural, features offstage piano quotes of Isaac Albeniz’s Tango and includes a second movement tarantella that ends with an emulated scream of insanity. A William Parker-led classical music response to this event included Ned Rorem’s song “A Dream of Nightingales,” and was conceived by Parker as ever-growing and never-ending.

NOTE: Genre and composer required. A 1995 article examining these musical works proposed an expected value based on the constraints m over 4 is less than or equal to a is less than or equal to m over 2. That article by John Putz cited outliers—such as a value of nearly 0.8 for a movement of one of these works that begins with a half-note open octave C, followed by ascending open-octave quarter notes E-flat, G, C, E-flat—as causing an r-squared value of 0.938 for one part of a claim made about these works. Putz thus dismissed that claim about these works, though he did note that the first of them, in C major, begins with a movement that has an exposition of 38 bars and a development and recapitulation of 62 bars. The eighth of these works, in A minor, may have been inspired by the death of the composer's mother. These pieces are the most-commonly cited examples of sonata-allegro forms supposedly divided at the golden mean. For 10 points, name these 18 works, the 16th of which is a C major “Simple” one.

This movement’s secondary theme is based on a repeated triplet-eighths plus quarter note rhythm, and begins with an ascending A-B-C-D, then B-C-D-E. E. M.

Like a related, purely instrumental style, this music usually includes a tambourine-like instrument playing a four-sixteenth note pattern with the second note slightly delayed, which creates an almost three-against-two-like “swinging” effect. This style was first recorded in the 1917 song “Pelo Telofone,” and it’s traditionally accompanied by a battery of percussion including a large surdo. A 1939 song in this style was titled for a “watercolor” of its home country. (*) Pagode is a subgenre of this style, which is performed by “schools” during an annual parade. This style partly derives from the musical accompaniment to Candomblé dancing.

A concerto in C major for this instrument is the most popular instrumental piece by François-Adrien Boieldieu (bwal-dee-oo).

This composer wrote the words “actual notes” above the following melody of half- and quarter-note triplets: (read slowly) long B-flat, low C-sharp, low E, long high E-flat, C. A ppp (triple piano) string chorale slowly shifts between widely spaced, non-dominant, diatonic chords to form the static background of a piece by this composer. This composer’s Two Contemplations initially paired that piece with one that calls for a grand piano and a player piano, and contrasts eerie strings with ragtime music. In a short piece by this composer, seven repetitions of an atonal trumpet melody are interspersed with increasingly frenetic woodwind quartet phrases.

The castrati Senesino and Gaetano Berenstadt premiered roles by this composer in an opera in which a natural horn opens the aria “Va tacito e nascosto” (vah TAH-chee-toh ay noss-COAST-oh). This composer included the aria “Se bramate” (SEH brah-MAH-tay) in an opera that puzzled listeners because it included many short ariosos rather than three-part da capo arias.

In jazz theory, a Tadd Dameron turnaround is made from a I–vi–ii–V (one six two five) turnaround by replacing all but the first chord via a technique named for these intervals. That “substitution” is effective because this is the only interval in 12-tone equal temperament that is invariant under inversion. This interval forms the bottom two notes of the “most influential chord” in modern Western classical music, whose deferred resolution represents unattainable desire throughout Tristan and Isolde. This interval occurs between the root and the fifth of the Locrian (LOH-kree-in) mode, and between the third and the seventh of a dominant seventh chord. It can be spelled as either a diminished fifth or an augmented fourth. For 10 points, name this interval made of three whole steps, which Guido of Arezzo (GWEE-doh of ah-RET-so) called “the devil in music.”

An ensemble led by Ignaz Schuppanzigh (EEG-nots SHOO-pont-sick) premiered many of the late examples of these pieces.

The movement following this one begins with the calm French horn solo (read slowly) “long F, G, A-flat, long B-flat” answered by flutes’ falling seventh chords. At the start of this movement’s coda, the massive dissonant chord (read slowly) “A-flat, D-flat, long G suspended to F, over C” slowly subsides, then returns to ffff (quadruple forte) in spasmodic blows in 3/4. In this movement, quick triplets in trumpets clash against a euphonium (yoo-FOH-nee-um) solo over steady string quarter notes. This movement shares its unusual meter with the polar opposite final movement, which uses an offstage chorus.

NOTE TO MODERATORS: Read relatively slowly. Given a chord in ascending order “B-flat G F-flat D,” this number is the third highest in its figured bass representation.
