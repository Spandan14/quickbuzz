On the left of this painting, restrained figures are cast into a pond, which is a device the artist repeats in several works and is thought to allude to the historical practices of Antoine Perrenot. Another element of this painting is an after-dinner musical performance on lute and recorder, which is mocked by a third player standing behind and playing the viola da gamba. Music is also used to mocking effect by a different figure playing the hurdy-gurdy as his wagon tramples one man and his horse bites a prone woman. Philip II's 1560 departure changed the political-religious climate in the Low Countries, which is thought to be the latent theme of this painting, as a mass of people are frightened into a trap decorated with crosses at the center of this work.

In another painting of this subject, he holds a book and wears blue, though as in Tura's version, different garments are strewn on the ground around him. Those both allude to the other frequent setting for this subject. The same artist, Albrecht Durer, has an engraving of that setting: an enclosed study with this subject at work at a desk, his cardinal's hat pinned on the wall.

An Annunciation by this artist takes place indoors but in front of a curtained bed, rather than the usual walled garden. One of this man's portraits depicts a cleric in a fur-lined robe, Ivo of Kermartin, reading a legal document with his back to an open window. Two of this artist's works are triptychs with similar architectural settings: all six panels are shown through a historiated Gothic arch. One depicts three scenes from the life of Saint John the Baptist, and the other was one of Max Friedlaender's most successful attributions since it had been thought to be a copy of a commission from John II of Aragon. Another painting by this artist depicts Joseph of Arimathea in a cloth-of-gold robe and the Virgin swooning as a cross-bow-shaped Christ is lowered from the Cross.

This artist's most ambitious work from his academic phase, The Captivity of the Jews in Babylon, was widely panned when it was unveiled at the Salon of 1848 and disappeared shortly thereafter. It was recently discovered that this man's The Young Shepherdess is painted over the earlier Captivity. In another work by this artist, the moon silhouettes a farmer's upraised arm against a hazy sky. A similar effect is achieved in a different work: two figures scramble on the ground to gather up escaping creatures as two men reach up to knock down the swarming birds, one holding a torch that lights the scene. Those works are The Sheepfold and Hunting Birds at Night. This artist added a steeple to the background of another work after it was complete; that work depicts two figures who have stopped digging potatoes to pray.

This artist's recent projects include a series of narrowly-defined indoor scenes that tend to contrast textures, the better to explore the capabilities of their medium, an iPad. Another of this artist's recent projects is the largest plein-air painting ever made: a wintry copse towering over red barns. Of that and other recent work in landscapes, one critic wrote "like Constable, he has returned to paint the landscape of his youth," though in fact this artist is from West, not East Yorkshire. That work, Bigger Trees Near Warter, follows this artist's earlier landscapes with its flat panes and bold colors, though earlier works tend to be defined by car journeys, like A Closer Grand Canyon, and take inspiration from travel brochures. In another indoor work by this artist, lilies in the foreground point to the pregnancy of the recently-married woman divided from her husband by an open French window.

One figure in this non-fiction work is quoted as saying "Alas, I believe in the virtue of birds. And a feather is all it takes for me to die laughing!" Near its beginning the author illustrates the subjectivity of the marvelous by imagining a castle in a rustic landscape where two of his friends Robert Desnos and Roger Vitrac are dueling. This work notes that the titular category applies to the Marquis de Sade when he is sadistic and Victor Hugo when he is not stupid. It attacks the tradition that has existed from the time of Aquinas, but which now continues in Anatole France. This work praises Paul Eluard and Louis Aragon, two of the author's close friends, and notes that the titular quality can be defined as works produced by thought without reason in a pure state, "exempt from any aesthetic and moral concern." Championing pure "psychic automatism," it was penned by the author of Nadja and Arcane 17 and signed by Max Ernst and Antonin Artauld.

One controversy surrounding this painting concerns the identity of its model, possibly the same as in a Coronation of the Virgin by the same artist. Mary Richardson compared the central figure of this painting to Emmeline Pankhurst, "the most beautiful character in modern history," who was being destroyed by "the government" just as Richardson vandalized this painting. The viewer of this painting is able to see the central figure's face, thus giving rise to a  namesake "effect," but the shared gaze between subject and viewer is rendered ambiguous by the indistinct image of the subject in the mirror, while the rear view of the recumbent subject of this work was an innovation for the form.

A fool and two others are shown engaged in this activity in Bruegel's Netherlandish Proverbs, in which the proverb means that success has more to do with luck than intelligence. Although this activity is not "descending the Missouri," raftsmen are engaged in it in a work of George Caleb Bingham. A painting of this activity by the Le Nain brothers influenced a later series of paintings of this activity in which wine and money are notably absent. In two works from that series, a rack with four pipes hangs on the wall behind those engaged in this activity next to an intent observer, all of whom are thought to be agricultural employees of the artist's father.

Another work by this artist features seated female nude sculptures situated at opposite corners. That work is comprised of planes colored peach, pink, and green, the last of which is a tall open window behind the title scene, The Piano Lesson. This artist situates a different scene in front of an open window; that work depicts a table heavily laden with food and is an interpretation of Jan de Heem's La Desserte. Two intertwined lovers seem to share a head next to a woman playing two recorders in the foreground of another work, while in the far distance a set of figures mirrors another of this artist's works.

In "Geographic and Algebraic Books," the adult Doufi proclaims himself Saint Adolph II. That collection from this country illustrates the artist's horror vacui by filling the page entirely with tiny holes and multichromatic figuration. Isabel Rawsthorne was the model for a series of works by an artist from this country, including Woman with Chariot as well as later, similarly elongated figures. Birds, some of them upside-down, inhabit a stylized floral landscape in a work by a different artist from this country, who also has a print of four mechanical birds performing the title action on a spit, Twittering Machine.

This artist created an ironic poster of a colleague's nude torso sculpture imagined as a Futurist-looking pen, introducing the Archie Pen Co, a play on the sculptor's name. That poster was exhibited at a show for an art organization whose French name was chosen without understanding its corporate meaning, the SocietÃ© Anonyme.

That man, known for works like Heroic Battle and Landscape with Tobit and the Angel that prefigured Romanticism, is Salvator Rosa. A commission to paint the Chapel of San Gennaro in this city was turned down by Guido Reni after an assassin was sent to murder him by a so-called "Cabal" of painters that may also have poisoned Domenichino (*) here and jealously threatened many others. After killing a man, Caravaggio fled to Malta and then to this city.

While in Paris, this artist broke from figurative painting, stating that "everything I saw became something to be made, and it had to be exactly as it was, with nothing added." That philosophy led to a work in which this man traced the shadow of a window to recreate its form exactly, called Window, Museum of Modern Art, Paris. A show at the Betty Parsons Gallery led to this painter's inclusion in the Whitney Museum's Young America 1957 exhibition.
