In November 2014, FreeBSD started supporting a ";lightweight"; variant of this system that allows for partial checksums. STUN uses this standard to determine if a device is behind a NAT (";N-A-T";) and is often used to find values reserved for it.

A common physics lab uses n of these devices in a "ripple counter" arrangement and LEDs to visually count to "two to the n" on a given clock signal, a technique which can be used to create frequency dividers. It is impossible to solve these systems completely from first principles for a given input without knowing the initial state of one of their two outputs, since they are a bistable (*) system. In integrated circuits, the inputs to these devices are typically passed through a Schmitt trigger.

This problem can be solved in exponential time on d for a sparse, d-degenerate input, improving on a more common algorithm that takes exponential time on the size of the input. Considering the complement of the input to this problem allows one to show that this problem is reducible to the vertex-cover problem. Using the highest degree node as a pivot vertex optimizes the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm for this problem.

One way of computing this quantity in exponential time is to employ a Monte Carlo algorithm developed by John Pollard, known as his namesake "kangaroo" algorithm. An algorithm for computing this quantity that works relatively well for orders that are smooth integers is partially named after Silver and Pohlig. The most powerful algorithm for computing this quantity can do so in sub-exponential time but is complicated by the fact that the selection of the factor base represents a tradeoff; that is the index calculus algorithm. The difficulty of computing this quantity is at the heart of a signature scheme developed by El Gamal. (*) The ability to compute this quantity efficiently would solve the problem of computing g to the power x times y given a group generator g, integers x and y, and the values of g to the x and g to the y, known as the Diffie-Hellman problem. In general, computing this quantity means that given a group element g and an element a of the cyclic subgroup generated by g, one must find an integer x such that g to the x equals a.

A seed can be used to create this kind of number from a pseudo-generator of these numbers -- which are used to model stochastic processes. For 10 points, name this kind of number generated for the purpose of simulating events like coin flips and dice rolls.

Layering this data structure can create a probabilistic skipping variety of them first described by William Pugh. Using separate chaining, hash tables can resolve hash function collisions by putting colliding keys into this kind of data structure. Its not a matrix, but the adjacency variety of this structure allows for quick lookup of vertex neighbors for finite graphs. Theyre not trees, but appending (*) a sentinel node to this data structure can speed up operations and avoid dereferencing null pointers. A node contains pointers to both its predecessor and its next neighbor in the doubly-linked variety of this structure. For 10 points, name this data structure that places items in a definitive order.

These are the most common constructs to be completely derailed by adversarial examples. A unit designed by Frank Rosenblatt couldnt simulate an XOR gate, but served as a building block to these constructs. Convolution and pooling are two techniques used when creating architectures centered around these constructs. These constructs can (*) adjust weights using forward and backward propagation as one way of implementing gradient descent. These constructions -- which usually make use of a sigmoid or ReLU (reh-lew) function --are made up perceptrons. The deep form of these constructs contains one or more hidden layers. For 10 points, name these constructs used for classification in AI that are modelled from the brain.

Christopher Strachey proposed that these objects should be treated as first-class, meaning they can be stored in a data structure or assigned to a variable. The anonymous types of these objects can be represented as their lambda type, using preceding square brackets in C++ [C plus plus] or an arrow in Java 8. These entities are tracked by storing their (*) return addresses in a call stack. The void keyword is used to indicate that these entities do not return a value. These objects are recursive if they keep making calls to themselves until a base condition is met. For 10 points, name these objects which can take arguments as inputs and return outputs.

These structures are implemented incorrectly in a fencepost error. During compilation, these structures are often optimized with a procedure called unrolling. The continue keyword passes control on to the next one of these structures within a program. Nesting one of these structures in another creates a program with a big O of n squared runtime. The keywords (*) in, for, and while are used to declare one of these structures. If one of these structures lacks a terminating condition, it will run infinitely until the computer runs out of memory. For 10 points, name these blocks of code, which repeatedly execute their contents until a condition is met.

Moderator Note: Read carefully This operators name was first introduced in the second volume of a book called Analytische Zahlentheorie, published in 1894 by Paul Bachmann. In a Taylor series, this operator can be used to express higher order terms that are negligible, truncating the series. For any function, f of x is this operator of g of x if f of x divided by g of x yields a (*) constant term. The quicksort algorithm runs in linearithmic, or this operator of n log n, time. For 10 points, name this notation, used for analyzing the efficiency of computer algorithms or a functions asymptotic behavior.

A dynamic set full of these objects is known as a radix tree. In Linux, grep is a command which can search these objects, and a command named for these objects can find and output them in binary sequences. In C++, these objects can be null-terminated using the character (*) 0x00 (zero-x-zero-zero). In Python, these objects are encoded by default using UTF-8 and have methods including split, len, and lower. These objects can be concatenated and are outputted by the print function. For 10 points, name this data type which stores text.
