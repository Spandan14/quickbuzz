This doctrine got its name from the "Letter to the Smyrneans" written by Ignatius of Antioch, in which he disagreed with those who held this position and said that they also refrained from prayer. Irenaeus wrote that Simon Magus espoused a version of this doctrine, which is directly at odds with John 1:14 and several other passages from John's Gospel. Found in such texts as the Gospel of Peter and popular among most Gnostics, this Christological doctrine which differs from Adoptionism has sometimes been theorized to derive from purely dualistic separation of matter and spirit, and those who held this doctrine rejected the Eucharist and the resurrection.

In its 24th session, the Congress of Trent condemned this practice, branding it a "detestable custom... [which] shall be uprooted from Christian soil." Fracois de Montmorency-Bouteville was executed by Louis XIII for engaging in this practice, which had been outlawed by Henry IV in 1608. This practice also came under attack from the jurist Jean de Savaron, who had argued that it was responsible for twice as many deaths as the French Wars of Religion, while Montesquieu's Persian Letters satirized this practice as the only way for French aristocrats to resolve differences arising from a "point of honor." The prevalence of this practice in post-Elizabethan England may have come from both an inflation of honors and the proliferation of rapiers, and those engaging in this practice were typically accompanied by a "second."

Charles Parham and William Seymore are regarded as the earliest founders of this type of religion, the latter of which created a diverse religious study center in Los Angeles known as the Azusa Street Revival. One of the distinctive marks of this movement is exhibition of the Charismata such as glossolalia. This religious sect has been described as the "third force of Christianity" in addition to Catholicism and Protestantism. This sect places great importance on the bible verse Acts 2:4, which describes the first instance of many where the Holy spirit descended to Earth and gave people the Charismatic gifts of healing and Speaking in tongues.
