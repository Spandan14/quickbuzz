The infant emperor of Russia Ivan VI was a male-line descendant of this dynasty's Brunswick-Wolfenbuttel branch. The "younger house" of this dynasty began with the fourth rule to bear its dynastic name, a son of Alberto Azzo II, duke of Este, while the "elder house," of this dynasty appears to originate with a man whose daughters Judith and Emma married Louis the Pious and Louis the German, respectively. Rulers from this family included Rudolf I of Burgundy, while another ruler of this dynasty went to war against his former wife Matilda of Tuscany, and this dynasty included a duke of Saxony who was atypically friendly with Frederick Barbarossa named Henry the Lion. This family's Hanoverian branch produced the royal line of England beginning with George I, and their chief medieval stronghold was Bavaria.

A nominally Christian faction of these people historically allied with the Holy Roman Empire in its conflict with the Danes. Following Otto II's defeat at the Battle of Stilo in Calabria, the Obotrites under Mstivoj launched a 986 uprising against the Empire aimed at overthrowing the imperial 'marks' in the territory of these people, who are also called the Lutici. That uprising successfully delayed Christianization, a process that was essentially complete in 1168 when Valdemar the Great of Denmark sacked Arkona on Rugen and tore down the shrine of Svantevit, the chief diety of the subset of these people known as the Rani. Earlier, an 1147 crusade led against these people by Henry the Lion devastated Pomerania and seized Lubeck, a major trading center and the former Obotrite capital.

One notable proponent of this goal advocated its "small" version and outlined the mechanisms by which it could be achieved in his Putbus Memorandum, while liberals such as Johannes Miquel, a leader of the National Liberal Party, typically advocated its "large" version. This goal was the one of the foundational points of the platform of the Progress Party, which also argued for the maintenance of the militia in case "these blessings have to be preserved or attained by war."
